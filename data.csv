The Agent-First Enterprise powered by Salesforce. A future where AI partners augment human consciousness and create a prime version of every employee.,"1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

06:58 [Sales Leadership, Sales Ops] To supercharge sales of an acquired product (like Slack), change the distribution model by fully integrating it with the core product suite. Allow the entire existing sales force to sell it and receive quota credit, rather than keeping it as a separate sales organization. (07:02, 07:05)
18:51 [Sales Leadership, AEs] To rapidly find valuable AI use cases, conduct an internal hackathon focused on a new AI tool (e.g., Agent Force) immediately after a major event like Dreamforce. This allows the team to identify specific applications that can dramatically impact company financials. (18:48, 18:54)
19:52 [Leadership] During strategic planning (like the V2 mom process), include an AI agent as a third partner alongside human executives. Use the agent to ask key competitive and strategic questions to expand thinking and get surprisingly insightful answers. (20:05, 20:11, 20:21)
26:36 [AE, SDR, Sales Leadership] Every sales rep should attend every meeting accompanied by their personal AI agent, which has been trained on all company content. This makes it inexcusable to not know the answer to any question about pricing, integrations, or product capabilities, as the rep can ask their ""digital"" self for the answer instantly. (26:42, 26:47, 26:56)
30:22 [Sales Leadership] Do not create a separate AI budget. Instead, integrate AI spending into the line-of-business budget. Hold the sales team accountable for using AI to achieve specific goals like efficiency and productivity, and tie the investment to their strategic objectives and compensation plans. (30:28, 30:32, 30:44)

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

13:12 Companies are beginning to set goals to reduce human employee headcount annually and replace them with AI agents, driven by factors like population contraction. (13:15)
19:27 The future of business is the ""agent first"" company, a fundamental shift where companies are built around AI agents, not just using them as add-on tools. (19:29, 19:31)
21:55 The correct paradigm for the AI era is not AI versus humans, but ""humans with agents working together to create customer success."" (22:00)
25:28 The modern enterprise platform requires three critical, interoperating layers to function: the apps, the data, and the agents, with robotics emerging as a fourth layer dependent on the others. (24:52, 25:41)
30:18 Creating a separate ""AI budget"" is a strategic mistake because it disconnects the technology from business outcomes; AI investment and accountability must reside within the line of business, such as the sales or service departments. (30:20, 30:52)
36:46 Achieving true ""organizational AI"" that benefits the entire company requires a unified, federated data layer; without it, agents and AI will not be as effective as they can be. (36:49, 36:52)

3.Key Quotes:

19:43 ""I think I might be one of the last generation of CEOs to say maybe you are too that we only had human employees.""
26:47 ""There is no excuse to show up to a sales meeting and not know whether this integration works in Slack what the pricing is for 10.""
30:18 ""I think that where there was an AI budget that was a mistake and that where it should be is like you should be holding... our sales team should be held accountable for that. And that is where the budget should be.""","AI, M&A, and the Future of SaaS: Lessons from Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO, Co-Founder and Chair","[00:03] maybe you are too that we only had human [00:06] employees. Even now I work with agents [00:09] every day to make Salesforce better. And [00:11] I train my employees to do that too. I [00:13] created this V2 mom process when I was [00:18] Salesforce for many years. And now for [00:21] almost 3 years when I write a V2 mom, [00:25] one I always have a Salesforce executive [00:27] with me and two I now have an agent with [00:34] the three of us working together. I like [00:36] having an AI partner. I think it helps [00:38] expand my own consciousness, gives me a [00:41] little more enlightenment myself. Hey [00:43] everybody at Saster. We have a treat [00:46] today after 12 years of SAS content, [00:48] 10,000 posts, 2,000 Saster annual [00:52] sessions. I added over 100,000 LinkedIn [00:54] posts, almost a thousand podcast, [00:56] especially the ones that Harry Stebings [00:59] a lot with Mark. We have the OG. We have [01:02] we have Mark Benihoff today to talk [01:03] about a bunch of things, but I want to [01:05] do a really practical discussion about [01:08] AI and B2B, the real stuff at the [01:10] application level. Well, Mark, thank you [01:11] so much for making time for your busy [01:16] thrilled to be here with you and looking [01:18] forward to the discussion. Okay, before [01:20] we get there, I want to talk about today [01:21] and to the future a bit, but one thing [01:28] about there, right? I think we did give [01:30] guidance at about 40.9 billion for this [01:35] like 12 or 13 or 14 billion in cash [01:37] flow. How does it feel? feels exactly [01:47] are important, but is it is amazing, but [01:51] Once in a while, I think we we almost [01:52] forget to celebrate milestones, right? [02:07] Like yesterday was an important moment. [02:09] We had a incredible Tableau user [02:12] conference. Yep. In San Diego. We had [02:15] 9,000 folks there. It was awesome. And [02:23] product I always loved. I always loved [02:24] the space. I always loved analytics. I [02:26] always loved business [02:27] intelligence. And then we were able to [02:30] buy the company, which was was a moment [02:37] bought it and then we introduced this [02:39] new product yesterday which is basically [02:41] completely new product. So inspired by [02:44] the original founders of Tableau and the [02:46] brand and the name but then delivering [02:52] all about apps and agents and AI and you [02:56] and how it all works together for our we [02:58] call our data fam. Yeah, which is the [03:09] always loved the product, but there were [03:16] exciting for me to be able to create the [03:23] Okay, [03:29] congratul. How long was Tableau on your [03:32] want list before you were able to make [03:33] the deal happen? Oh, forever because [03:37] are meaningful in our industry. And [03:41] trade once. So, you have to decide, is [03:44] this going to be part of your solution? [03:48] that idea of business intelligence [03:50] analytics and even in the era of AI that [03:53] this new Agentic front end, this vision [03:56] of Agentic analytics combined with the [03:59] marketplace of apps and the semantic [04:03] layer, the ability to talk to Tableau in [04:16] been so limited to needing an analyst or [04:19] someone that can run a product that I [04:21] loved, I used I always I admired at [04:28] about seven years or something. But it [04:30] takes a while after you buy the product [04:36] team. you are really looking at what are [04:38] all the different pieces that are I [04:41] would say relevant for the customers. [04:43] You have to understand the community. [04:47] they are successful as a company. And [04:53] using Slack. Everyone loves Slack. Right [04:57] And guess what? This moment that is very [05:00] important that we need to be able [05:06] not the same old Slack. We are [05:08] incrementally taking the same playbook [05:20] The fundamental direction of Slack with [05:22] AI. Slack and AI. Those are two ideas [05:24] that were really made for each other. [05:29] all live in Slack and it should just do [05:31] it should be my meta agent. It should be [05:33] my meta agent for everyone at the [05:38] Slack should be my meta agent for all [05:40] that data. Yeah. And my vision is if [05:44] you are in sales. Yeah. Exactly right. [05:48] modal. That was something that I always [05:51] incredibly hard to execute because [05:56] been built with a whole different [05:58] approach. But this is possible. And I [06:01] think the Tableau really got there [06:03] yesterday. And if you have a chance to [06:06] pretty impressed. I will do more and we [06:09] will write it up. But M&A. So Mulesoft [06:12] last quarter 22% growth after years [06:15] after you bought it, right? Tableau 16. [06:17] Slack, everyone has their opinions on [06:19] Slack because we all use it, right? [06:26] going to lose the even if you had [06:28] going to lose the DNA. How do you bridge [06:33] running it. How do you bridge the [06:35] founder DNA when you buy it? Revenue [06:43] many software products in the [06:44] billions and these are and I think that [06:48] Slack had a huge year last year. Not [06:50] only because the product is great. [06:52] Competition let their guard down I think [06:54] a little bit. But number two is that we [06:58] changed our distribution model for Slack [06:59] last year. Nobody really saw that, which [07:02] is that we allow all of our Salesforce [07:05] to sell it, get quota credit for it, to [07:09] basically made a pure product with the [07:12] rest of our products. And it it was a [07:14] huge supercharge for the product. And [07:19] up to that point, we were trying to keep [07:20] it how it was, keep it going, give them [07:23] more reps, more of this, invest in it, [07:25] run it as a separate company, but then [07:27] eventually we just hit the button and [07:29] said, you know what, this thing is [07:31] amazing, but it needs to come together [07:36] going to see that incrementally, [07:37] especially as we get to Dreamforce, how [07:39] all the things that are critical with [07:41] Slack are really going to be deeply [07:43] integrated with Salesforce as well. [07:45] Yeah. is there and just is there in the [07:48] deep enterprise is teams really even a [07:50] competitor is this a social media [07:52] fiction or is it a real competitor? You [07:55] can see the horrible things that [07:57] Microsoft did to Slack before we bought [07:59] it. And yeah, that was pretty bad. And [08:02] they were running their playbook and did [08:07] a written up in an EU complaint but [08:10] Slack made before we bought them and you [08:13] never really know what Microsoft is [08:15] going to do. But that was pretty nasty. [08:22] really admire what Microsoft did with [08:24] Slack and how they used a lot of their [08:27] assets to really try to attack them when [08:33] Microsoft. So to do these things, I was [08:36] did not find them to be on the up and [08:38] up, I would say. Yeah. It was an odd [08:40] time. 2021 is like the a generation [08:44] different world where it seemed Slack [08:46] and Zoom probably seemed like these huge [08:48] they were going to bring down Microsoft [08:51] today. You should support these [08:52] applications in 2021. They seemed like [08:54] they were taking over the world. You can [08:56] see that playbook being used. We saw it [08:58] on Netscape. We saw it on many things. [09:04] that that playbook should get ripped up [09:06] and thrown away. Yeah. Yeah. uh the [09:09] there is an inherent aggressiveness in [09:10] enterprise software but there are limits [09:13] as well can see it by the way getting [09:15] played out right now between open AI and [09:21] over the weekend this kind of really [09:23] interesting presentation that Sarah [09:25] Frier used to work at Salesforce and [09:29] revealed their stack for the first time [09:31] their their data center their apps their [09:34] APIs all the different aspects of the [09:37] future of open AI I and the word [09:42] on the stack and that was extremely [09:45] interesting and you can see how [09:48] Microsoft is really starting to run a [09:51] separate playbook against open AI and [09:56] in the history of open open AI because [10:01] so funny to think about Microsoft taking [10:03] pot shots at Slack because Azour is so [10:09] it as competitive but as open as you [10:15] Microsoft thinks. Microsoft is a company [10:17] that wants to own it all, control it [10:20] all. If they see a hot company or hot [10:22] startup, they ask themselves, hey, why [10:24] is that not in our world? and and in the [10:27] case of they usually they like to either [10:29] try to feain an acquisition and then [10:32] based on that they execute a playbook or [10:36] in the case of open AI a partnership is [10:39] going to become a competition. Yeah. No, [10:42] for sure. So related to that on AI, let [10:44] me ask you a question. I think maybe it [10:46] was right after your last earnings call. [10:49] class of App Exchange in 2006, but I saw [10:53] Man, I saw energy in you recently after [10:58] about AI, right? Is it like a [11:00] refounding, a re a rebirth of enthusiasm [11:07] Salesforce [11:11] just did a product oxide with my top 35 [11:13] product leaders for 3 days and the [11:16] opportunities ahead are just absolutely [11:18] incredible. What is going to happen with [11:20] software and the transformation of [11:21] software at every layer is going to be [11:24] beyond our expectation, beyond our [11:26] imagination. And you can start to see [11:28] some of that playing out already. You [11:30] can see it in a lot of places. You can [11:32] see it in the startup community, but you [11:34] can also see with the customers, too. [11:37] back from two weeks in Asia. And that [11:40] was really motivated. Oh, yeah. I mean, [11:42] it was really I was like in Bhutan and [11:45] the king of Bhutan is using Slack to [11:48] manage their new mindfulness city. So, [11:52] when I see the technology were being [11:54] used in kind of creative and exciting [11:56] new ways, I get really motivated. Even [11:59] the hotel that I was staying at in [12:01] Bangkok, all of a sudden they had to [12:06] how we use it in our hotel. And then I [12:12] largest software company in Japan. We [12:14] have a new Salesforce tower on the [12:16] grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. [12:21] Japan, you got to let me know ahead of [12:26] the customer success is probably the [12:28] highest we have in the world. And some [12:30] of these incredible Japanese companies, [12:34] is just awesome. Yeah, we were there in [12:37] November for a couple founders of Edge. [12:38] I can let you know next time. It was [12:42] when I met it with a lot of founders, [12:43] especially folks 100 millionaire is a [12:45] lot there, right? And the but the the [12:47] shrinking of the population is tough. [12:53] contraction. This is a worry at a [12:56] seeing annual annual seat contraction [13:03] saw that actually. I met with one of the [13:05] largest companies in Japan and yeah, [13:08] meeting with one of their sea level [13:09] officers and they have a goal to reduce [13:12] the number of employees they have by 5% [13:15] every year and replace them with agents. [13:17] So that [13:19] was really a remarkable conversation. [13:23] The population change is is very real in [13:28] a group talking about seek contraction [13:30] due to population contraction. [13:35] ever happens. The So, you said you just [13:37] got 35 product leaders together, [13:38] something like that. There was It just [13:40] went out that Toby leaked from Shopify [13:43] published his memo telling everyone to [13:46] of that at Salesforce? What are you [13:48] telling folks to stay current and to be [13:53] about Agent Force. I a year ago, Agent [13:56] Force was just beginning to be an idea [14:01] customers who are implementing it, way [14:03] more than we could have expected at this [14:07] are implementing agent force and to [14:09] already see so many success stories and [14:12] to see this product in these customers [14:15] hands at this kind of very early and [14:19] other products because usually you roll [14:21] while for the customer to get value and [14:27] birthed from within the platform it [14:28] makes it very easy for customers to [14:30] deploy. When I was in Asia I was with [14:33] Singapore Airlines is a huge customer [14:35] ours and has been for a long time. Yeah. [14:41] and service and Slack and marketing all [14:42] the things you expect. But the power of [14:45] Singapore Airlines is that the CEO, his [14:54] building an agentic layer over the [14:55] airline. And that was very motivating [15:02] from idea to this point where these [15:06] customers are able to deploy huge amount [15:08] of value in a relatively short period of [15:09] time. Yeah. So many folks talk about, we [15:13] run out of time about AI for changing [15:15] coding and programming. You talked about [15:17] freezing hiring and engineering. I want [15:19] to get to that, but most folks are not [15:28] Force is at the bleeding edge of it. [15:32] Salesforce has help. We have 9,000 [15:38] than a half a million of these [15:40] interactions with customers and agents. [15:42] But that idea, I think, is pretty big [15:44] and pretty incredible. Yeah, it is. Do [15:53] invested early in a bunch of folks in [15:54] the contact center gorgeous, which has [15:55] 20,000 Shopify customers and talk desk [16:00] folks already reducing headcount there [16:08] thinking that I would like to try to do [16:12] deploy those resources to other parts of [16:14] the company where I desperately need [16:16] more help and more capability. And I [16:18] encourage customers to really look at [16:20] that. That said, customers, especially [16:23] large companies like ours, the ability [16:25] to do something like that in a material [16:32] going to do in a year and underestimate [16:35] decade. And that is where we are with [16:37] this as well, which is that yes, we can [16:40] the contact center, but we might be [16:43] saying that a year from now or two years [16:44] from now still and then incrementally [16:51] still at the beginning of a lot of these [16:53] opportunities. Yeah. Have you So we [16:55] rolled out a little AI just on Saster [16:57] itself. We had 30,000 conversations in [16:59] one month, which is pretty crazy. And a [17:01] lot of one of the things that surprised [17:02] me, I thought I knew about AI until I [17:06] really interesting how people do things [17:11] someone had a half an hour board [17:13] discussion about how to work with their [17:14] board. They up they shared their board [17:16] deck. They reached out to me. They did [17:25] seen that are unexpected are also [17:29] like talking about some of these [17:31] customer stories. Yeah. The Singapore [17:32] Airlines story, the Salesforce story, [17:36] a half a million conversations as we [17:43] And then when I see like really solid [17:46] customers of ours, Lenar, which is one [17:48] of the largest home builders in the [17:53] about of not just using our apps, they [17:55] use all of our apps and do all the [17:57] customer work, but how can they really [17:59] provide more service to their customers, [18:01] how can they provide more revenue lines [18:03] to their customers? And that idea that [18:10] happening right now. that idea is going [18:13] down that this is going to be something [18:15] that these customers are going to be [18:18] served by these agents and for LAR they [18:21] have given us incredible revenue [18:24] projections based on what they have [18:26] found and I think that is going to be [18:31] lot of customers. I think a lot of [18:33] customers going to all of a sudden start [18:38] LAR zone. Yeah. They called me [18:40] originally at CEO Steuart is credible [18:42] person father was the founder of the [18:45] company and he said our guys went to [18:48] Dreamforce they came back and we did a [18:51] hackathon here on agent force and then [18:54] we have these five use cases and if they [18:57] going to dramatically impact the [18:59] financials of this company and that is [19:04] seeing customers say hey how do I really [19:06] use this technology in an exciting new [19:08] Okay. And then deliver that value. And [19:10] that whole cycle from idea to innovation [19:13] to actually delivery with LAR cuz [19:21] fast. And also is that the end of their [19:23] story? No. This is the beginning still [19:25] of the story. Because when we think [19:27] about what are companies going to be [19:29] like that are going to be agent first? [19:31] What is an agent first salesforce or an [19:33] agent first LAR or an agent first [19:39] those founders who are starting [19:43] the last generation of CEOs to say maybe [19:46] you are too that we only had human [19:49] employees. Even now I work with agents [19:52] every day to make Salesforce better. And [19:54] I train my employees to do that too. I [19:57] created this V2 mom process when I was [20:01] Salesforce for many years. And now for [20:05] almost 3 years when I write a V2 mom, [20:08] one I always have a Salesforce executive [20:11] with me and two I now have an agent with [20:17] the three of us working together and [20:21] key questions. For example, hey, how is [20:25] this competitive against these key [20:27] competitors? or is this going to really [20:29] expand our distribution capacity like we [20:31] want or is this what we want to have [20:33] happen with our ecosystem and the [20:36] answers are [20:37] surprisingly awakening that is all of a [20:42] so I like having an AI partner I think [20:44] it helps expand my own consciousness my [20:47] gives me a little more enlightenment [20:53] extremely important that founders use [20:57] that for a saw the last generation with [21:02] get it. Like I thought it was a great [21:03] catchphrase, but even with now we have [21:06] our agent AI come to meetings and what I [21:08] love about it is it also remembers [21:12] what Mark Beni off said on that podcast [21:14] 2 years ago, but you know what? Your [21:16] agent remembers it and can contextualize [21:22] going with the prime version of myself. [21:24] the digital version of me just remembers [21:31] I think that idea that there is an agent [21:36] totally there. Like here we are on the [21:39] with us. I think in 6 months we will. [21:47] Okay. And now what question do you want [21:49] to ask Mark Ben off about the future? [21:54] little tagline that I used at Dreamforce [21:55] last year which was humans with agents [21:58] working together to create customer [22:00] success. And I believe that I think that [22:04] this is about us working well with [22:07] yet. Still, if you go to [22:11] beginning of what that could be. And I [22:14] think that for a lot of our customers, [22:18] that agentic layer means. And then over [22:22] just say this also the agentic layer is [22:25] very important but we still have human [22:28] about you. So a few less than a year ago [22:32] but yes we have a lot of people that [22:42] because of just demand levels are [22:44] impressive. [22:45] So I would say that at that point [22:48] applications are still important. Like [22:57] service cloud, our marketing cloud and I [23:02] with field service, but I was on the [23:04] phone yesterday with the CEO of a very [23:07] large power utility. We have two amazing [23:10] ones in California. Both of them are [23:11] huge customers of Salesforce and our [23:14] field service app. If you go to app [23:17] we this amazing field service app like [23:20] these apps are still really important. [23:22] And in this case of like fire [23:24] mitigation, especially in California, [23:31] we can do things to to prevent [23:34] wildfires. Apps are still important. [23:36] Humans are still important in this case. [23:40] yet. Maybe there will be soon. Agents [23:43] can only go so far until you get into [23:45] the natural [23:46] world. So, this is a big moment where we [23:57] The data is way more important than ever [24:01] agents are not going to perform with the [24:06] wearing a shirt. my favorite customer [24:11] just buy all of the stuff on Disney [24:13] Store, not because it runs on [24:15] Salesforce, but because I just love the [24:16] brand, love the products and go to the [24:18] parks and the hotels and all that. But [24:25] through all of their products. But they [24:28] have done such a great job as a company, [24:30] Disney. They have so many products no [24:32] human could possibly understand all of [24:34] the products and the combinations and [24:36] the promotions. Yep. But the AI offers [24:39] tremendous value at that point for the [24:42] customer and for what they call the cast [24:44] member which is their employee and that [24:47] is critical and this idea now that the [24:52] apps the data and the agent these three [24:55] layers together and for Salesforce [24:59] that new version of Tableau I mentioned. [25:01] Yep. You look at that and you take a [25:05] Twitter feed I have a stack diagram of [25:12] AI thing running out there in the wild. [25:17] in our company to create a better [25:19] company and AI and agents are a key part [25:21] of it but so is the data and so is the [25:28] agents all working together. and that [25:30] idea of these three critical layers and [25:33] then like last week I was on a zoom with [25:36] the CEO of an incredible robot company [25:38] in San Jose and that fourth layer is [25:41] going to be the robotic layer but it [25:42] needs the other three layers to operate [25:44] because the agents are going to get [25:47] manifested into these robots. So that [25:54] four layers all have to work together [26:00] Now, we sell it in different kinds of [26:01] brands and flavors and this and that so [26:06] And that is going to be incredibly [26:08] important going forward for these [26:10] customers, especially as they scale [26:11] these implementations and make this [26:13] these enterprisewide implementations [26:15] that are going to be like [26:17] transformational for how they [26:18] interoperate with them, their employees, [26:27] this before was I actually think within [26:29] 12 months this agent human combination I [26:32] think every single Zoom every single [26:34] meeting every sales rep every cast [26:36] member every person human should come [26:39] with their AI and we I trained mine on [26:42] 12 years of 10,000 pieces of content and [26:44] all this stuff it knows there is no [26:47] excuse to show up to a sales meeting and [26:49] not know whether this integration works [26:51] in Slack what the pricing is for 10. [26:56] know I should be able to say digital [26:57] mark remind me how does this Slack plus [27:01] Tableau integrate with a 1970s SAP [27:05] implementation and you should have this [27:07] the answer like that should be like 12 [27:09] months cuz I can already do it on our AI [27:17] about humans and agents working together [27:20] and you just articulated it beautifully [27:23] And look, you might be there, but most [27:27] there until 3 weeks ago, but now I get [27:29] it. Now, now I get it cuz I tried we [27:32] Brian I tried to used to talk to digital [27:34] Brian Halligan. He was early. It was [27:35] pretty funny from HubSpot, but he and [27:42] to train this to S level S tier level. [27:44] And I trained it on everything. And now [27:48] Zoom, then first of all, he can answer [27:51] all the questions at night and on [27:52] weekends. And if he comes to every [27:55] literally no excuse to not know every [28:00] excuse to not know how every custom tab, [28:02] every [28:11] All right. One people talk about all [28:15] the money comes from AI. What are you [28:17] seeing at budgets? Is there really an AI [28:19] budget at Leonard and Singapore? Are [28:21] they repositioning budgets? Are they [28:22] stealing it from old boring stuff? Like [28:25] incremental money really coming from in [28:27] your experience? I think you have two [28:29] things going on. First of all, we just [28:31] talked about how exciting AI is and how [28:35] transform them and transform these [28:37] employees. But for the vast majority of [28:41] around with these models and tools over [28:43] the knack last call it 3 years or four [28:51] stories of how AI has transformed these [28:56] why Agent Force is as exciting as it is [29:05] action plan on exactly how to go ahead [29:07] and execute the AI playbook for a [29:10] company. And in a lot of cases, you had [29:12] a lot of like just little science lab [29:15] experiments and those things did not [29:17] work out for those customers. So that is [29:20] really step one. I think everybody needs [29:23] a win. Everybody needs a [29:25] help.salforce.com. Yeah. To that point, [29:32] predictions. We do all this stuff. But [29:37] impacting my business process itself. [29:40] Okay. So, everybody needs a huge win. [29:43] That is really the next step. Yeah. And [29:49] got to be excited about Agent Force [29:53] invested in the platform this has got to [29:55] be on my top two or three initiatives [29:56] right no question but where am I going [29:58] to my CEO and asking for more budget is [30:01] it take like just I just want from this [30:03] sort of overall money GDP going into [30:11] into the line of business budgets and I [30:14] think that this is just an extension of [30:18] think that where there was an AI budget [30:20] that was a mistake and that where it [30:22] should be is like you should be holding [30:24] at least this is what I do. I should be [30:26] holding our service team accountable. [30:28] Our sales team should be held [30:29] accountable for that. And that is where [30:32] the budget should be. It should be the [30:34] need to get this much more efficient, [30:35] this more productive. You need to [30:37] augment your employees. You need a [30:39] higher level of enablement. You need [30:40] more capacity. you need to be able to [30:44] integrate your compensation plans into [30:45] our strategic goals. All of these things [30:47] are going to be done with [30:49] AI. But should there be a separate AI [30:52] budget, I think that could be an [30:54] right direction because if you have a [30:58] probably not integrated at that level. [31:02] really closely with [31:03] RBS Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. [31:08] McKay, and they have an incredible AI [31:10] team. They have an [31:12] incredible set of PhD researchers. They [31:16] come out of University of Wateroo in [31:20] Shopify guys. And this is a great bank, [31:24] great institution, great customer. And [31:27] for a couple years, he keeps coming to [31:30] doing that. I want to do this. I want to [31:33] getting the value that he really wanted. [31:35] And then I was working with his wealth [31:38] team which is actually based in the US [31:41] and all of a sudden we had some [31:45] was like hey you really need to look at [31:47] this is the very tactical practical [31:52] wealth business a lot more successful [31:56] center to not only service your [31:58] customers but sell mortgages also. [32:03] this fundamental transformation I think [32:05] in their consciousness they all of a [32:06] sudden realized not only could they do [32:08] all of these things but they could start [32:10] think about things strategically for the [32:12] future of their bank that they were not [32:14] able to think about before and that this [32:17] AI was going to really give them a [32:19] capability that was not on their [32:24] an AI budget. This comes out of your [32:26] line of business managers really having [32:28] to think about what is the future of [32:32] going to have the best impact. Not just [32:35] having the two dozen worldclass AI PhDs, [32:51] reasons why Agent Force has been as [32:53] successful as it has been so early on. [32:58] see a lot of great stories. Yeah, wealth [33:01] management really should be a space [33:07] terrible service. Like just I want a [33:09] mortgage, I want a line of credit, I [33:14] someone gets back to you in two weeks. [33:19] healthcare. I like just had a full [33:21] recovery from a proximal rupture of my [33:24] Achilles last September and the number [33:27] of phone calls I have to make and all [33:33] layer on the medical center is really [33:34] important. I just spent some time with [33:36] the medical center that I work really [33:37] closely with showing them exactly what [33:39] we can do, how we can do it, the [33:42] immediate impact they can have, and the [33:48] about the Japan situation, but think [33:50] about it like this. Call any doctor or [33:52] nurse or medical center you work with. [33:58] out for some reason. They never [34:02] know if I did myself, but the thing is [34:08] get their labs from their done and they [34:10] call their doctor right away. Hey, this [34:12] number is not exactly right. What is [34:14] going on with this number? Doctors will [34:16] talk about it on your visit, but instead [34:18] there can be an agentic layer [34:20] surrounding the medical center that kind [34:21] of provides that first level of care, [34:23] but also it can not only do pre and [34:26] post-operative care, pre- or post [34:28] procedure care, but it can also do [34:32] coming to the hospital. You want to make [34:38] still get phone calls. And when I get [34:40] some of these phone calls, I can tell [34:42] these people who are making the calls, [34:50] that the medical center is going to have [34:54] that the people are going to be used in [34:56] a more value added way. And I think [35:00] help.salesforce.com as well. Yeah. So [35:05] because this is great. But maybe just [35:07] two things that people talk a lot about [35:11] understand. You talked about people, [35:13] agents, data, and then robotics, right? [35:15] I might have gotten the four layers [35:19] data. Everyone on social media and in SF [35:22] talking about I can disrupt everyone in [35:24] the enterprise with my agent. But data, [35:29] Salesforce. So talk about that and like [35:33] invested in any of the best. Who wins? [35:34] The incumbents or the startups? I know [35:37] think about that? Who wins the [35:38] incumbents or the startup? I think [35:42] of data. And I think that when I get to [35:44] Dreamforce in October, I have to clear [35:48] And I think one way to think about that [36:00] Salesforce data, which is 230 pabytes of [36:04] federating to. Of course, Salesforce was [36:06] core investor in Snowflake, but we [36:08] federate to data to Snowflake and now [36:12] that comes back to Salesforce through [36:14] our federation mechanisms as well. So [36:27] your company, all of that needs to be [36:29] one consistent data layer for that agent [36:32] to be able to really be as good as it [36:35] can be and for that AI to be everything [36:38] you want it to be. We can talk about [36:40] individual AI like we did, which was, [36:42] hey, are you remembering my meeting? [36:44] What is my next step? But when we get to [36:46] organizational AI, that means that that [36:49] data layer has to be this federated data [36:52] layer that is going to have to then be [36:54] fully interoperating with those apps and [36:56] those agents and all of it is going to [36:58] have to be one seamless platform for [37:02] going. I think that vision is a little [37:04] different than where everybody else is, [37:06] which is everyone else is a little bit [37:08] more on and by the way, I think this is [37:10] great for a lot of the startups to do [37:15] going to take down this use case. I [37:19] provide for our customers, which are the [37:22] largest and most important customers in [37:24] the world, enterprises and governments, [37:26] we want them to get their data together. [37:28] Number one. Two, we want them to use [37:30] this next generation of apps like we can [37:33] see like Tableau next that we showed [37:37] continuing to get released from [37:39] Salesforce. And then three, we want them [37:41] to deploy these agents at scale. And I [37:44] think that is the right transformational [37:51] And that platform, that as a platform is [37:54] different than what others are working [38:11] running all together as one thing. And [38:17] incredible 26 years of Salesforce. When [38:20] we started [38:21] Salesforce, we could never have [38:23] anticipated that we would have gotten to [38:28] billions like you said. And as I think [38:35] years ago. I guess the best decision we [38:37] probably ever made was not that [38:39] technology architecture or strategy. [38:44] of our profit, and 1% of all of our [38:46] employees time 26 years ago and put it [38:49] into a foundation. We just had a board [38:51] meeting for a foundation just last week. [38:58] hours of volunteerism. We run 50,000 [39:04] billion dollars to organizations all [39:07] over the world, but especially focused [39:10] in K through2 education, which is our [39:12] focus area. And in our San Francisco and [39:16] $150 million. So, wow. This idea that we [39:23] is a platform for change in those areas [39:26] as empowered and enabled through the [39:27] foundation is extremely important and [39:29] trying to hold those values together as [39:32] we get bigger as a company. This is a [39:41] people should be holding us accountable [39:42] that whether it is in trust in customer [39:45] success and innovation in equality in [39:48] sustainability these core values of who [39:53] maintain these core values and also [39:55] deliver this next generation of our [39:57] platform and we want every customer to [40:00] have this incredible value experience [40:02] with AI and that is what is really going [40:05] to get me super motivated over the next [40:08] couple of years. Yeah. And for folks cuz [40:12] everyone really should check out [40:13] Salesforce has a whole program to help [40:16] whole program pretty turnkey for you. [40:20] called pledge1%.org that me and the [40:22] founders of Atlasian who also then [40:24] copied our 111 model have put together. [40:28] take a look at that because you might [40:32] year in, but 25 or 26 years later, which [40:36] a lot of people are like, ""Oh, no. I [40:37] have already sold my company and we [40:38] retired in Hawaii, whatever."" Great. [40:44] back and say, ""Hey, I did it the right [40:48] not going to want to be like some of [40:50] those other software companies that we [40:51] mentioned who maybe operate with a whole [40:52] different kind of set of values. So, you [40:55] have to decide what kind of company you [41:00] when you rolled it out but I remember [41:01] when you back in the day thinking Mark [41:05] like 2 billion at the time 1% is 20 [41:19] your technology and how you can most of [41:21] our podcast has been about technology [41:23] you can impact all these organizations [41:25] with your techn so when you deliver a [41:29] going to get the most power. Yeah, I [41:32] of one, we used to do a lot of promotion [41:35] during the lockdown days of it with [41:37] Byron Peter and others do more because [41:40] honestly sales the pledge 1% in the team [41:48] overloaded, you can get help here. You [41:50] can roll this out pretty quickly and [41:54] wonderful almost mini foundation that is [41:59] want to have a great technology model, [42:01] you want to have a great business model [42:03] and you want to have a great [42:05] philanthropic giving back model because [42:09] look back at your company and say, [42:11] ""Hey, did I do it the right way?"" Not [42:14] just did I hit the technology home run [42:15] that I was looking for, but what kind of [42:18] impact did you have across the board? [42:23] this is great. Anything we hit? Anything [42:25] coming up at Salesforce the next 12 [42:27] talk about. We talked about celebrating [42:34] start and end with Agent Force, you know [42:40] underestimate data cloud. been our [42:43] fastest growing product ever and the [42:45] revenue levels are awesome. We rolled [42:49] fastest multi-billion dollar product [42:52] ever. And then the fundamental [42:53] regeneration of all these core apps. [43:00] cool stuff coming. And by Dreamforce and [43:02] I hope everyone will be there and [43:06] have an incredible vision for the future [43:13] the next generation of AI Salesforce. [43:17] piece of the journey. And Mark, [43:18] congratulations. Thanks for the time. [43:19] Thank you. Really appreciate it. Great. [43:22] with SAS. It makes a huge difference for [43:24] the whole industry. Everybody really [43:25] appreciates all the work and time and [43:30] Byebye. Appreciate the extra time.",2025-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwQzpwZDhjQ
"Proving AI's ROI with business metrics, not vanity stats. This is a founder's playbook for linking AI adoption to concrete business outcomes, such as reducing roadmap delays, rather than just tracking AI-generated code.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

6:29 [Leadership, AE] To launch a new product, create a specialized ""go to market incubation team"" that is separate from the core sales force. This team's compensation is tied exclusively to selling the new product, ensuring they are focused on finding the initial product-market fit and sales motion.
6:58 [Leadership, AE] Once the incubation team proves the new product has ""legs,"" transition it to a dedicated ""product line sales team"" of 10-20 sellers. This team also has its compensation tied only to the new product, allowing the company to scale from initial traction (e.g., 0 to 10 million) to a more significant revenue stream (e.g., 10 to 100 million).
7:15 [Leadership, Sales Ops] Only enable the core sales team to sell a new product after the specialized teams have scaled it to a significant milestone (e.g., $100 million) and have fully developed the sales process, pitch decks, and resolved initial product issues.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

12:52 In the AI era, a core product strategy is to use AI as a ""co-pilot"" to simplify complex enterprise products, making them easier for customers to use and manage without deep technical skills.
14:16 A major opportunity in the AI era is not just using AI in your own product, but enabling your customers to solve their own AI challenges, specifically by addressing the data access, security, and governance problems that are bottlenecks for their AI initiatives.
16:54 To effectively and safely adopt AI internally, companies must establish a cross-functional ""AI governance committee"" that includes legal and infosec, with the goal of enabling, not blocking, AI adoption.
18:27 Simply providing AI tools to employees is not enough for adoption; leadership must actively push teams to use the new tools, gather feedback, and iterate to drive change.
21:22 The biggest challenge in adopting AI is proving ROI, as ""AI is not cheap."" Success should not be measured by AI-specific metrics (e.g., % of AI-generated code) but by its direct impact on core business metrics, such as reducing product delivery delays or improving quality indexes.

3.Key Quotes:

11:20 ""with customers all they want is acknowledge your mistakes.""
8:27 ""you have to say yes to yes to everything, right? Because if if you lo if you miss a large Fortune 500 customer... you have to figure out you say yes, but then you have to figure out what is that piece of it that they truly need.""
22:45 ""at the end of the day I think you have to wear the business hat and say are you making things better for the business"".",AI and Cybersecurity: Scaling Rubrik to a Billion Dollar Enterprise with Rubrik's Co-Founder and CTO,"[00:00] AI is not cheap. Welcome to the people [00:04] and this is where a lot of disaster [00:05] speakers projects are getting stuck [00:08] ROI. So the way we are doing it is we [00:10] are looking at it as business metrics. [00:14] have a plan of release right road map [00:16] can we reduce the net delay in road map [00:19] items delivering that to the business. [00:21] So if we say oh we deliver in Q Q3 [00:24] did we deliver 15 days later 30 days [00:26] later right and we want to reduce that. [00:30] business understands and then we have AI [00:32] metrics where we say how much code is [00:36] the day we measure ourselves by did [00:38] these two business metrics actually go [00:42] matter I can do I can do 100% AI code if [00:46] makes no difference to the business [00:49] hey everybody get excited we just hosted [00:51] 10,000 of you at the Saster annual and [00:54] AI summit in the SF area it was insane [00:59] year. It was a deep dive on everything [01:01] new, everything AI, everything go to [01:04] Saster AI is coming to London in [01:10] Saster AI to the heart of Europe. This [01:13] is your chance to connect with thousands [01:14] of SAS and AI executives, founders, and [01:17] investors, all sharing the secrets to [01:20] founder, a VC, a revenue leader, Saster [01:23] AI in London is where the future of B2B [01:25] meets the power of AI. And we just [01:27] announced tickets and sponsorships. So [01:31] to grab your tickets. Saster AAI in [01:34] London, where B2B meets AI and the next [01:36] wave of innovation begins. See you [01:38] there. [01:40] [Music] [01:46] Well, good morning everybody. How you [01:48] doing? [01:50] My name is Kit Colbert, formerly CTO of [01:53] VMware. took some time off and just [01:56] started as CTO, platform CTO for [02:00] to have Arvin with us today from Rubric [02:05] So Arvin, maybe tell us a little bit [02:10] well. First of all, thanks thanks for [02:11] having me here. [02:13] So Rubric, we started Rubric about 11 [02:15] years ago. [02:17] And the goal was to really build a [02:20] platform that provides cyber resilience [02:22] to businesses. [02:24] From the time we started to now, cyber [02:27] attacks have only been increasing. And [02:28] our goal is to provide a whole set of [02:32] attack, how we can recover quickly. And [02:34] what can you do before a cyber attack to [02:36] protect your data, which is your most [02:37] critical asset. We just finished, as I [02:39] said, 11 years. Uh we rounded out the [02:41] last decade by going public last year. [02:47] driving the company forward. Cool. So [02:53] progress to date. I think we have a [02:55] slide here with some of the high level [02:57] numbers. Amazing amazing results. Again, [02:59] congratulations. Over a billion in ARR. [03:01] Yeah. [03:04] You know, you started with a a core [03:06] product and then you scaled to multiple [03:08] products. This is I think a challenge a [03:11] to grow and and continue scaling. How do [03:14] you think about that? I mean I imagine [03:18] engineering perspective as well as a go [03:20] to market perspective. No, great [03:22] question. I think so with any company [03:24] right so as you build out products [03:28] know certain part of the product grows [03:30] to certain scale you can only grow it so [03:34] friction. So the the way we have thought [03:36] about it is that we need multiple kind [03:38] of curves of innovation, right? So as [03:39] one product gets to a mature stage and [03:46] can bring in a second product which now [03:48] accelerates the business and that starts [03:50] growing at like 100% every year and that [03:52] that kind of so overall your overall [03:54] curve of growth stays stays high [03:59] products [04:00] and we think of ourselves as really [04:02] having multiple pillars in the data [04:04] protection data security and now AI [04:06] space [04:13] which is very critical [04:18] running a lot of the new products that [04:21] we sell the sell today the in our [04:23] portfolio all started with the hackathon [04:27] hackathons since we just finished our [04:31] doing it from our from year two of the [04:33] company and uh it all starts with a few [04:36] engineers spending 24 hours hacking up [04:38] something and and saying hey this is [04:44] we have last year I think we had 130 [04:46] submissions out of that we take the top [04:48] 10 we review them and then we go into we [04:50] actually go and review all the [04:51] presentations and then pick out ideas [04:53] that that may be interesting and then [04:55] and then take it to product. So lot [04:57] almost all of them started that way. [05:00] whole question of as we get into a new [05:04] build versus buy question right and [05:06] there have been cases where we felt [05:09] usually when you want to build is either [05:18] achieved momentum and if you can bring [05:19] that in but there have been cases where [05:22] we started with a build option and then [05:30] question and then as you bring these [05:32] products in or even build it organically [05:34] over time as you start scaling you have [05:36] to start thinking about platformization [05:38] right initially you start doing stuff [05:42] okay now for example for cloud products [05:44] earlier each team kind of built their [05:48] actually taking all the core platform [05:50] areas and creating a generic platform [05:53] on the on the R&D side [05:56] and then obviously you have to make [05:57] investment decisions how much just [05:58] invest in the core business versus [06:00] innovation and so on. And then on the go [06:06] incubation engine. So the way it works [06:17] certain way and the the current product [06:19] works well and then they know they can [06:20] sell other ones and how does it fit into [06:25] enable like 500 sellers to do this. So [06:27] what we do is we create a initially we [06:29] create a go to market incubation team [06:31] and these folks they only make money if [06:34] waking up every day thinking okay how [06:37] the initial path finding and then what [06:40] they do is they say okay this is the and [06:46] engineers product managers [06:49] sales folks maybe one marketing person [06:53] and the product and then once you see [06:55] okay that this is this has legs Then we [06:58] transition to what we call a product [06:59] line sales team. And this is think of it [07:01] as scaling these two to three sellers to [07:03] maybe like 10 20 sellers who can now go [07:06] and really again again they only get [07:08] paid for selling this product. So they [07:09] go and now scale this to the next level. [07:11] So think of it as zero to 0 to 10 10 to [07:14] 100 and then once it hits 100 million or [07:15] something then you can say now enable [07:17] their course by that time you hashed out [07:23] so the whole decks and everything all of [07:25] that have been built. Yeah, I imagine at [07:27] that point the core sales team would [07:29] have some conviction in the con take it [07:31] to a customer and the product is also [07:35] not getting like bumps on every every uh [07:37] PC that you do. So then it it gets ready [07:41] have this conveyor belt of what we call [07:43] RX which is our incubation to product [07:45] line sales to core and we have we have [07:47] done multiple products in in in this [07:54] continue talking about scaling and you [07:56] know, a couple of numbers up there. 39% [07:58] year-over-year growth, which is amazing, [08:00] and 80 NPS and getting a score that high [08:07] of curious as you go through this really [08:11] multiple products. How do you keep that [08:13] customer satisfaction so high? Yeah, the [08:16] the one learning for me through the [08:18] through this journey is that with [08:20] especially with large enterprise [08:27] that. I think you have to say yes to yes [08:28] to everything, right? Because if if you [08:30] lo if you miss a large Fortune 500 [08:33] customer, it might be 100k deal down the [08:38] can build with a customer. So, you have [08:39] to figure out you say yes, but then you [08:40] have to figure out what is that piece of [08:42] it that they truly need. and and distill [08:45] it led down to that in in terms of uh [08:48] supporting customers. One of my [08:50] co-founders and I were were actually the [08:52] first support people. So from like the [08:54] first beta customer we had, anything [08:58] folks taking the call, working with the [09:00] customer, figuring it out. And a lot of [09:02] our founding engineers would do the [09:10] from the beginning. And that is kind of [09:12] like interesting. percolated through the [09:14] entire organization. Even today if a [09:16] customer says hey I have a problem [09:19] engineer will drop everything and jump [09:20] on it. I support sales engine everybody [09:24] it. [09:28] of it is culture the and we always keep [09:32] emphasizing that make the customer [09:33] successful nothing else matters. So I [09:37] on that point a bit that you as a [09:39] co-founder were there CTO were there [09:41] hands-on in support doing that because [09:46] that have kind of an ivory tower sort of [09:50] give you an example. There was a early [09:51] stage there was a customer at 400 p.m. [09:53] they said this customer is really in bad [09:56] shape. It was a it was a law firm. There [09:59] was some issue and their their email [10:00] system was impacted. So literally at I [10:04] booked a flight for that night, took the [10:05] red eyee, I was on I was with them two [10:08] days and just sitting there until they [10:10] it was resolved and then flew back. So [10:12] you got to do things like this in the [10:14] early stages and you got to show that [10:15] you care, right? And the other other [10:17] learning is that obviously as you scale, [10:21] Not every implementation will go as [10:25] what customers need is first of all be [10:27] transparent. [10:32] you an example. Very large retailer in [10:34] Europe. They had this huge Oracle [10:37] database. They came and said we need [10:42] initially there was a lot of questions. [10:43] Can we do it? Then we realized this is [10:45] requirements. So one of my engineers and [10:48] I actually went in front of the customer [10:49] and said you know what [10:58] happen today but we will invest in this [11:03] it to you but if you want to go with [11:04] somebody else I would totally we totally [11:06] understand that so you should make the [11:09] it next day they came and said you know [11:13] transparent not trying to sell them [11:14] something that later they they realize [11:16] in there I think is key. The other thing [11:18] is there will be mistakes again with [11:20] customers all they want is acknowledge [11:22] your mistakes. [11:24] We are very very open about this was our [11:28] is our bad and we start with that we [11:33] experience you should have had these are [11:34] the mistakes we made and we are doing [11:36] stuff to fix that and here are steps to [11:38] that we will get you into a better place [11:42] lot of people are not able to do that [11:44] and because their customers get [11:45] irritated saying at least acknowledge [11:48] seen and this is something that we have [11:50] a truly world-class support team our [11:58] the one who took took over from us and [11:59] threw us out of the support room. You [12:01] guys go build the product and he really [12:03] built this uh great support team and uh [12:08] say you know what your support team is [12:11] percolates all the way from sales to [12:13] support to engineering and so yeah it [12:16] customer intimacy that you guys have had [12:18] from the beginning. Yeah, absolutely. [12:25] Now, [12:27] I I I tend to break AI down to a couple [12:30] different buckets. We think about it in [12:32] terms of technology vendors. How do we [12:34] build AI into our products and then how [12:36] do we leverage AI internally in terms of [12:38] our internal operations and how we [12:41] both of those. You start with the [12:42] product. What has your product strategy [12:46] absolutely right. We are thinking of it [12:47] exactly what can we do in the product [12:50] talk about the product. The product we [12:52] think of it as in kind of two ways. One [12:57] easy right? If you think of an average [13:01] platform to protect their data that [13:02] could be sitting in the data center [13:04] could be a VM could be a Oracle database [13:08] cloud VMs cloud databases you know [13:13] SAS as well. And then there is we have [13:16] built a whole suite of security products [13:18] which very often the IT persona may not [13:20] even have the skills if there is an [13:23] next. So the first step is to really can [13:26] we actually provide an assistant or [13:27] co-pilot if you will for the rubric [13:29] product to really make it easy and [13:35] AI companion for for our for our SAS [13:38] platform and what it does is it really [13:40] says so for example if you say oh we [13:45] is what it means and then it say okay [13:48] recommend and what this does is it uses [13:50] our knowledge base documentation [13:53] support articles wiks and it also is [13:56] able to query [13:59] the product itself through APIs put it [14:01] all together and answer the question so [14:04] the I would say making our product more [14:06] usable we want to do as we scale we want [14:14] us scale the second piece is really [14:16] about how can we as our customers are on [14:18] this AI journey how can we enable them [14:20] to build the AI applications they need [14:25] of stuff on the foundation models and [14:28] everything but most of the time is not [14:30] spending is not spent in foundation [14:34] is in okay how do I get access to the [14:36] data that I need to solve this [14:37] particular use case how do I make sure [14:39] that first of all is am I adhering to [14:42] the security permissions that that are [14:46] there and then more importantly even if [14:47] you have access to some data what if [14:49] somebody puts something sensitive in [14:50] there say financial documents exposed to [14:53] all of engineering right and then every [14:55] engineer can ask a question and will get [14:56] an answer from that so um [15:00] so this is where a lot of the time is [15:07] and very often infosc saying no and we [15:10] want to say no we want to say yes but we [15:18] been building exactly all of this a we [15:20] take all the enterprise data put it in a [15:25] every day, every every few hours. We [15:28] understand permissions so we can [15:29] actually make sure that you only see the [15:33] then we can automatically suppress any [15:35] sensitive information mask it so that it [15:40] going to manifest itself on the other [15:42] side. So, so we were like wait [15:46] well suited for the problems that the [15:49] announced a product called Anaperna [15:53] the right use cases uh and customers are [15:56] also in the very early stage of [16:00] of uh potential there and very excited [16:07] actually two sort of aspects of this [16:11] your product with generative AI to help [16:13] the customer and automate a whole bunch [16:15] of stuff, make them better at what they [16:16] do. But then that second bucket seemed [16:20] customer do AI themselves like they have [16:22] AI projects. Solve can we solve the data [16:23] problem from it? Focus on your business [16:25] use case. Focus on your workflow. Focus [16:27] on building the right kind of agents but [16:35] and concern about what sort of data do [16:38] you have data leakage? Where is that [16:39] going? How can you manage that? Okay. [16:47] within Rubric. How are you as a company [16:49] adopting AI? Yeah. So for the very same [16:52] same reasons, we actually at very early [16:54] stage we set up a an AI governance [16:56] committee. The goal there is to really [16:57] have infosc legal everybody coming [17:00] together with the goal of enabling AI [17:04] adoption across the company but doing it [17:09] has been very effective. But then there [17:10] was a lot of like grassroot stuff. [17:12] Somebody saying, ""Hey, I want to try [17:13] this."" It would go through the [17:16] say, ""Hey, is this secure or not?"" And [17:17] then if it was secure, they say, ""Okay, [17:18] go ahead and do it."" So we started [17:20] seeing a lot of projects pop up. Then we [17:23] together. There are lots of tools being [17:24] used. Maybe we can consolidate."" And [17:29] said a lot of the stuff we could just [17:30] build on top of the our own platform. So [17:33] we actually did a whole AI summit. And I [17:39] actually a VP of legal was actually run [17:44] think this is the first time, but we [17:45] were talking backstage about this. I [17:47] heard of like legal running this thing. [17:53] rubric first strategy so that if we can [17:57] So, uh what we did, we brought in like [17:59] people across all organizations. People [18:02] were sharing notes on what worked, what [18:05] generative AI works, rag and all of [18:11] going to come come up with these are the [18:13] business metrics I want to solve and [18:17] success of the AI initiative like AI [18:21] that cross functionally and then make [18:23] sure that as a business we are able to [18:25] do that. But one of the learnings is [18:27] that even if you put these tools out [18:34] you got to keep pushing people to go [18:35] adopt it saying no no no things have [18:38] give me feedback let me fix it now try [18:40] it so you kind of have to keep pushing [18:42] so that people adopt it in an [18:43] organization and while balancing [18:45] security and everything else that you [18:50] LinkedIn you feel that everybody is like [18:53] doing AI like crazy but in reality in a [19:06] different it is to like their workflows [19:10] them and and to be honest definitely in [19:14] huge potential gains that we see so we [19:17] are really pushing everybody to to start [19:19] using AI for their coding obviously in [19:21] research and any kind of product [19:24] lot of stuff that AI can help with so [19:26] yeah so we are adopting tools and and [19:29] trying to do that in a in a safer manner [19:33] which we can do that. Got it. One [19:35] question I had for you was to combine [19:41] yourself, putting AI into practice and [19:43] what you mentioned before about how most [19:45] businesses they have AI initiatives but [19:49] learning about it and how are you [19:51] applying that in your customer [19:53] discussions? Yeah, I think the the thing [19:56] is that you have to bring first of all [19:57] you got to bring all the different [20:01] infosc you got to make sure that they [20:04] bottles so bring them early [20:07] to the conversation so that they are [20:09] they agree that this is the right [20:11] approach and then everybody is aligned [20:12] and pushing that forward and then I [20:15] think there is a lot of you got to put [20:17] stuff out there people have got to try [20:21] that people can use their imagination [20:23] sorts of things with that but until you [20:25] get it out there get the adoption going [20:29] value is so I think you need to give [20:31] people time to experiment get familiar [20:33] experiment and then the best practices [20:36] will show up so it requires so we are [20:46] metrics where are the bottlenecks are [20:47] the specific teams that are struggling [20:49] so you have to kind of almost run it as [20:51] a program got it I imagine as well. You [20:54] being you being founder or co-founder [20:56] probably helps as well. Go founder mode [20:58] on it. Yeah, sometimes I would put my [20:59] coordinator on and there you go. All [21:01] right. Okay. We have just a minute left, [21:04] but if you want to ask a quick question, [21:05] we can go into the lightning round here. [21:07] Quick question then. So about adopting [21:10] AI in the business. How do you evaluate [21:13] ROIs? Do you really take care care of it [21:15] before uh like a P or after PC? Please [21:20] share your experience. Thank you. Great [21:21] question. This is actually the biggest [21:22] challenge right because AI is not cheap [21:27] right and this is where a lot of [21:29] projects are getting stuck because [21:33] way we are doing it is we are looking at [21:34] it as so rather than just look at any AI [21:38] specific metrics we are looking at [21:41] example for engineering for engineering [21:43] we are saying a can we [21:46] we have a we have a a plan of release [21:48] right road map can we reduce the net [21:52] delay in in road map items to delivering [21:54] that to the business. So if we say oh we [21:56] deliver in Q Q3 [21:59] did we deliver 15 days later 30 days [22:01] later what was the what is the net delay [22:03] right and we want to reduce that so [22:06] business understands the other thing is [22:09] this hopefully by moving faster are we [22:12] keeping the quality bar high so we have [22:13] a what we call like a quality index that [22:16] looks at defects per account and stuff [22:20] saying are we making sure that we drive [22:22] those down so at the end of the day and [22:24] then we have AI metrics where we say how [22:25] much code is generated by AI or how much [22:27] what is the MTR for certain defects and [22:33] the day we measure ourselves by did [22:35] these two business metrics actually go [22:39] matter I can do I can do 100% a code if [22:43] business metrics it makes no difference [22:45] to the business so at the end of the day [22:46] I think you have to wear the business [22:50] the business hat and say are you making [22:52] things better for the business what are [22:53] the metrics you track there and then [22:55] have secondary AI metrics that would [22:58] hopefully drive these higher level [23:00] metrics. So at least [23:05] we are following right now. That makes a [23:07] lot of sense. Stay grounded. Focus on [23:10] up in the in the high ground. No, signal [23:12] to noise is is low. All right. Well, [23:16] thank you all for the questions and [23:17] Arvin, thank you so much. Really [23:18] appreciate it. Thanks for the [23:19] opportunity. Thank you.",2025-06-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8N9MzITlEM
"The AI GTM Paradox. Achieving superior results requires more, not less, high-quality human orchestration and a commitment to daily training.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

[08:29] [Leadership/Sales Ops] Plan to spend at least two weeks onboarding your AI, treating it with the same time commitment as a new human hire.
[11:10] [SDR/AE/Sales Ops] The person managing the AI should spend 30 minutes every morning training it, especially in the first two months.
[12:11] [SDR/AE/Sales Ops] Audit the AI's chats and questions for 15-30 minutes daily to find and manually correct errors, as the AI will not make the same mistake again once corrected.
[14:57] [Sales Ops] Connect your CRM and marketing automation platform data to the AI tool to provide it with historical context.
[15:29] [SDR/AE/Sales Ops] Perform a ""brain dump"" of institutional knowledge that isn't in the CRM directly into the AI platform to give it more context.
[16:37] [Sales Ops] Enrich your current data for warm leads (e.g., website visitors) with fresh data from enrichment vendors to provide the AI with the necessary fields for effective outreach.
[18:14] [Sales Ops/Leadership] Before launching, create a clear structure for the AI, deciding on hyper-segmented campaigns rather than blasting everyone at once.
[20:05] [SDR/Sales Ops] Prioritize ""warmbound"" campaigns targeting people who have already interacted with your brand (e.g., website visitors, past event attendees) as they will always perform better than cold lists.
[24:45] [SDR/AE] When a lead responds to an AI-generated email, the human-in-the-loop must respond instantly to meet the expectation of real-time engagement set by the AI.
[32:33] [AE] Shift from traditional ""discovery"" calls to presenting a ""working theory."" The AI has already gathered the data, so the AE's job is to come to the call with an informed hypothesis about the prospect's needs.
[33:26] [AE] Before a call, use tools like Claude or ChatGPT to research the company and ask it ""Why should they buy my product?"" to quickly form your working theory.
[36:56] [AE] To create a follow-up email, use the desktop version of ChatGPT to listen to a recorded sales call and then ask it to write the follow-up email based on the conversation.
[37:25] [AE] Use AI tools like Gamma or GenSpark to create a fully customized proposal or sales deck in minutes by providing it with the prospect's needs, desired pricing, and company assets.
[40:41] [Leadership/Sales Ops] To scale the creation of high-quality, custom AI-generated collateral, hire a dedicated ""AI marketing ops person"" to manage the process, as it's too time-intensive for every rep to do themselves.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

[00:41] High-quality AI in a go-to-market function requires more work, not less. The trade-off for higher output and quality is increased human effort in managing the AI.
[00:49] AI will lead to needing fewer humans in certain roles, but the employees that remain will be higher-skilled and need to work harder.
[08:42] AI tools must be trained with the same rigor and time commitment as a new human employee to be effective. You cannot just turn it on and walk away.
[27:47] AI alone is not enough. It requires a ""human in the loop"" to handle nuanced responses, provide oversight, and perform tasks the AI cannot, making it an additive tool, not a replacement for skilled humans.
[32:35] AI fundamentally changes the role of the Account Executive from information gathering (discovery) to information synthesis and validation (presenting a ""working theory"").
[43:21] The success of a sales AI initiative depends more on the quality of the human orchestration and management (""S tier orchestration"") than on the specific AI tool being used.

3.Key Quotes:

[00:44] ""More work for for better output, right? You might need less humans, so you could have less humans, but the ones that you do have are going to be working harder.""
[32:35] ""So instead of coming to a a call to do discovery, you come with a working theory, right?""
[43:05] ""This requires human orchestration. It does not require some crappy human or agency... You need S tier orchestration to create S tier output.""","What’s Working Now: AI’s Real Impact on Sales with SaaStr's CEO and Co-Founder, and SVP & GM","[00:00] So net an interesting thing from all [00:06] now can do 5,000 interactions instead of [00:17] what a lot of folks, especially CMOs [00:20] that I talk to or sometimes CRO that [00:25] less work.

[02:17] Welcome back to SAT AI Live. We thought [02:21] we would do something fun today. Um, [02:26] lot at Dster. I know you guys have seen [02:32] like you guys have an insatiable [02:33] appetite for some of this stuff. So, we [02:39] lot, specifically for sale, outbound [02:42] calls, a little bit marketing. Um, but [02:48] the pitfalls and and just to preface [02:54] of AI. I would still consider us early [02:58] different AIs now probably for a year or [03:02] so if not more um in different ways. But [03:08] on, but seeing some good initial results [03:10] that we shot we would share with you [03:16] because I feel like this is where uh we [03:19] have I just got the bad outbound email [03:22] this morning. That was [03:24] that was I hope from an AI. Maybe it was [03:26] actually a person. I assumed it was from [03:34] using AI for real? So in the last two [03:38] weeks and that was at the time the only [03:41] time we had been on this platform that [03:44] in just two weeks little after [03:48] became the highest response rate on the [03:51] platform that we use for our AISDR. We [03:54] opened pipelines we booked meetings we [03:56] touched labs accounts. It both seems [04:01] historical human averages we had with [04:08] mix ads. Um, these are screenshots here [04:14] could send 4,495 [04:17] messages by those in two weeks. And to [04:19] do it at a hyper personalized, hyper [04:23] scale that actually is adding value. So [04:30] in IT takeaway is your AI has to be good [04:33] enough to also add value if you want to [04:35] see these kinds of results. Like if [04:43] not going to get these types of results [04:49] doing better than any historical human [04:56] just to preface there, it does take one [04:58] a lot of tuning. Um, and it does take a [05:02] lot of data and a lot of conscious [05:05] effort to get these AIs to work this [05:08] well and have this good of a overall [05:10] response rate, positive response rate, [05:12] and also to make the emails seem like we [05:15] actually wrote them. There are [05:17] screenshots in this deck of people [05:20] asking me it two things. Like one, is [05:32] too. Like if your AI adds value to the [05:36] an AI versus a human? [05:38] >> Maybe just add let me add one context [05:41] This is great and well these are good [05:43] results. [05:44] >> A few caveats for folks depending on [05:46] where you are in the journey. One is we [05:48] have a pretty big brand. [05:50] >> Okay. So that helps. People have heard [06:00] 100,000 of sponsorships. People know us. [06:07] many like this is we could never send [06:10] this many good emails. We could send [06:12] this many emails. Just just just send [06:13] them. We could never send this many good [06:15] emails. [06:16] >> But we have a brand and two this is all [06:18] to our base. [06:20] You have to do a two by two. Do you have [06:21] a brand? And so is there some reason [06:23] people will interact with your email? [06:24] And two, is this is this just raw folks [06:28] have never heard of you, did not opt in, [06:30] or are these folks that are you already [06:32] have some sort of relationship with? And [06:34] I think Amelia, all 449 of these folks [06:37] are folks in our database that have [06:38] participated in Saster that have opted [06:46] scale with humans. [06:48] >> Yeah. Some of them are website visitors, [06:52] AI that do this now. So there are folks [06:53] that are on your website. [06:55] >> They know us but they know they know [06:59] these are some good learnings justif [07:03] and you have no base to email from. No [07:07] to see these results. You may see you [07:14] off the charts well brand our own base [07:17] and lots of training and lots of [07:19] iteration not just turning on and [07:21] walking away like most people do. So [07:22] just just for some context those three [07:24] points but yeah keep going. [07:25] >> No super helpful. You talked about it. I [07:28] want to talk about it a bit more in [07:29] depth because how to train it. I already [07:33] right. I literally was just dealing with [07:36] to the webinar. I have a quick question [07:41] it is not quick. [07:45] like the wrong mindset. Like if you [07:53] happen, dude. Like a lot of trading. I [07:57] would say I have almost dropped a lot of [07:59] other things I should have been working [08:00] on. And I think Jason, you were talking [08:02] about yesterday on Twitter like you [08:07] same now for this particular sales tool [08:12] still does take a lot of time. Like at [08:14] the very start, you should expect to [08:16] spend the most like basically all your [08:18] time with it. Like these two weeks were [08:20] also the two weeks I spent the most time [08:22] on the AI SDR. I spend less time with it [08:24] on the outbound now because it got [08:29] have two weeks to onboard your AI, just [08:32] like you would spend two weeks [08:36] it. Like, you literally need to spend [08:38] the same amount of time, maybe more, on [08:42] training the AI that you would a human [08:44] being. Like, you got to train it. You [08:49] one maybe tradeoff or nuance people [08:54] nuance of that being you can do it when [08:57] you want. [09:01] would tune my AI first thing in the [09:03] morning and then last thing in the [09:06] the morning, maybe an hour in the [09:07] evening, maybe more, and then I would [09:09] respond throughout the day pretty much [09:12] in real time if I could to any responses [09:14] that our AI was getting in real time. [09:21] to noon Pacific to do the training that [09:25] the same amount of time. So pros and [09:27] cons, but let me get into one of the [09:29] biggest things is you got to train it [09:33] with all your data. And this has been I [09:36] would say even for us a little bit of a [09:38] hurdle. We have so much data at Saster. [09:40] Like you guys have probably talked to [09:48] in it, I think, and counting, right? [09:50] Because we post new content on Saster [09:56] us, right? Like if you think about or if [09:58] you have multiple product lines or if [10:00] you also produce a lot of content or if [10:10] which is millions upon millions upon [10:16] probably another couple million. like [10:21] to work with your AI and so you know I [10:27] you will become AI revops but I get why [10:29] now after spending like almost two full [10:32] weeks with our AI it takes a lot of time [10:34] and like to do it right you do need to [10:38] off the street to do this for you if you [10:44] wicked smart that actually knows how to [10:46] use AI I and actually knows your [10:48] business to feed the right data inputs [10:51] to the AI. [10:55] >> On our AI, our general purpose AI you [10:57] can chat with on the homepage, you know, [11:03] point, for the first two months up until [11:06] Saster annual list, every morning I [11:10] spend 30 minutes training it. And [11:12] training can mean different things. Like [11:17] the base AI, not for sales, which [11:18] Ameilia get into, she can talk about how [11:20] she trained it. For our sort of generic [11:25] 100,000 chats on it. It had to ingest 20 [11:27] million words of Saster content, all of [11:29] our SAS annual sessions, all my tweets, [11:31] all of our YouTubetubes, all of our [11:32] videos, everything. But there, like very [11:35] specific questions were really good [11:36] because it had ingested all that data. [11:38] Where it would hallucinate or make [11:43] data. For example, [11:45] if you asked it about a speaker that we [11:46] had at Sastro that actually spoke, what [11:48] does Stuart Butterfield say the two [11:51] right? Then if you asked what the CEO of [11:53] notion said at Saster, who never came, [11:55] it would make something. [11:57] >> Um, and the worst, the most, and so [11:59] those were a little funny. And the most [12:00] extreme one was we had not published [12:02] >> the dates for Saster 2026 or Saster Lond [12:06] AI London this year yet. And so we [12:09] them up. So what I would do is every [12:11] minute I would just audit the chats, [12:12] audit the questions for 15 or 30 [12:17] errors, but the ones that were were [12:18] egregious like that, right? And then I [12:20] would go in and I would manually write [12:22] the question and manually write the [12:23] answer, okay, in a train in the training [12:27] make the mistake again, unlike a human. [12:28] Like a human would make the mistake the [12:29] next day, right? But I had to do it [12:31] literally for almost half an hour for [12:33] two months every morning. Every morning. [12:36] And so now it now I do it once a week. [12:40] metaphor for even if you have all your [12:42] data in, even if you have it all in, you [12:44] may have to QA it every single day for [12:46] the first couple months. [12:50] on every AI SDR tool, all of them have [12:53] different rule sets. This is trained on [12:58] right? So like some of our AI is trained [13:00] on more of our data. Some AI train on [13:05] mean you have to train on all your data. [13:06] like more context is good, but at the [13:09] end of the day, what your AI is looking [13:11] for and what you really need to trade it [13:13] on is what do you want it to surface to [13:21] are or people who are visiting your [13:23] website, who are already on the website [13:24] and kind of know at least a little bit [13:28] Um, then basically what you want to tell [13:32] website, what are they doing on the [13:34] website? Okay, great. The AI will tell [13:37] you that right away. It already knows [13:40] website. Next, okay, let me go look in [13:42] maybe your CRM or your marketing [13:46] necessarily need both to see, okay, is [13:50] account. Like, have they been to Zaster? [13:52] Have they sponsored with you? Are they [13:59] this customer and every close [14:01] opportunity. Half the time, let me tell [14:02] you, the people on the website might not [14:04] know that. They might be lawyer number [14:09] history and context of SAS and Oracle [14:11] from back in the day. And like a few [14:14] words of that context from your AI is [14:18] it will get them to open and respond to [14:20] your AI and probably take the call and [14:25] you also need to just think about the [14:26] mindset of okay a lot of data is but it [14:31] not need to be perfect and we started to [14:33] hyper segment more and actually like rip [14:35] out some of the data from this to make [14:37] it more hyper segmented and actually a [14:39] little bit more simple and that is part [14:45] So, just to train your data, if you [14:47] will, to get this to a working state, I [14:53] about doing this, right? Um, so one, [14:57] your CRM, your marketing automation [14:59] platform data. Hopefully, that is in a [15:03] working stage in which you can use. So, [15:10] for your AI to adjust it. Each tool kind [15:13] of has its own way where you can say [15:14] okay make an artifact and say okay um [15:17] hey by the way IBM was the sponsor this [15:24] of like you would in your brain right [15:25] like the same way a human brain works [15:29] this let me do a brain dump of my human [15:32] brain to the AI brain of things I know [15:35] that are in our CRM you can do that a [15:37] lot of these platforms have a way you [15:38] can do that man to do that at least once [15:42] Hook up any of the major both of the [15:44] tools. Hook up to all the major [15:46] platforms. Some of them are listed [15:49] probably do some data cleanup to a [15:51] bearing degree based on where you are [16:03] work as good if you started from zero. [16:07] AI, I probably need to get started with [16:10] yet. You might want to spend the next [16:13] even like six weeks of data might be [16:14] enough for it to get up and running and [16:16] going with something so it has some [16:19] historical context to help your open [16:21] rates. I think otherwise it will start [16:23] to default to being too generic and [16:27] rates and like lower positive sentiment [16:29] scores. [16:31] The other thing I did as part of this a [16:32] lot of where we send our kind now that [16:34] we did an additional data cleanup is [16:37] enriching our current data and those [16:40] warm leads the warm outbound so like [16:42] people on our website people covering [16:44] disaster events with fresh data right so [16:49] 20 different vendors that do this [16:52] obviously a good way is to scrape your [16:54] website itself and see what you have so [16:56] maybe in your journey you might need to [16:57] do step two more than you need to do [16:59] step one to get all the fields you need [17:02] to work with AIS. So the other thing [17:06] different AI STR tools have certain [17:09] requirements of fields that you will [17:11] need to have in order for it to send the [17:13] really good emails. I you know each of [17:15] them have kind of weird quirky certain [17:19] wants to 100% make sure it finds the [17:22] right person on the internet to say okay [17:24] this is the person that you are trying [17:26] to prospect like beyond a certain of a [17:28] doubt you know that is what the AI is [17:32] it needs those kind of quirky certain [17:34] fields to do your prospecting and [17:36] outbound for you. It wants to make sure [17:39] like, you know, I typed in Ameilia Laroo [17:50] 10 of them. Well, this is why the AI [17:52] needs all those fields so it can make [17:56] at the right company. The last thing you [17:58] want is for it to send an email to the [18:00] right person, but wrong data points of, [18:03] oh, hey, I saw you at Fox. and actually [18:08] what the AI is actually trying to avoid. [18:12] three would be actually thinking through [18:14] before you start a structure for the AI. [18:17] Two and three go hand in hand, right? [18:19] You may need to even take it a step [18:27] you know you want to necessarily start [18:29] blasting everybody that comes to your [18:32] website in real time because you can. [18:37] of the things that perform the best is? [18:38] Yes. What do they do on our website? [18:41] What are they doing on SAS? Have they [18:42] been to an annual? Have they been to [18:44] Euroba? Have they been to all these [18:46] workshops? Um what stage are they in? [18:49] All those things like that. Recent [18:50] funding news, job title changes, pain [18:53] points, like some of this that will [18:54] scrape for you automatically. All this [18:56] to say on points one through three. [19:00] where it knows enough about the exact [19:04] will write a really good email that you [19:07] would have otherwise had to spend [19:10] writing yourself. That is the whole [19:12] point of training the data and getting [19:14] the structure right is to write the [19:17] email good or better than you would have [19:20] yourself obviously at a much faster rate [19:23] at a much higher scale right like I [19:27] in two weeks. So, we talked about it a [19:34] been true of marketing since before. The [19:36] more you can hyper segment it, the [19:38] better it will work. [19:42] Ask yourself, what have you ask [19:43] yourself, what has this person done with [19:45] our company lately? Have they been to a [19:47] customer dinner? Did they go to the [19:49] website? What do they read on the [19:50] website? So, ask yourself, what have [19:53] they done with you lately? And how does [19:55] that tie to them maybe showing intent to [19:58] buy or could you get them, you know, [20:00] down a path where they have an intent to [20:02] buy? Jason mentioned it as one of the [20:04] caveats. I have it here with number [20:05] five. Prior tracing what I call what we [20:08] call warbound always works, right? This [20:11] is always going to work better um than [20:13] any like old list you could scrape off [20:16] the internet and say, ""Hey, um AISDR, I [20:19] just got this list out of 100 companies [20:21] that are in the top 100 companies. start [20:25] work as good as you giving that list to [20:30] emailing them,"" which is probably not [20:38] Again, at the end of the day, you want [20:42] targeting. have some context with all [20:46] with you and what your value ad to them [20:49] is so that it can write an email that [20:52] will start to add value to the person. [20:54] You can call them a prospect, you can [20:56] call them an account, call them whatever [20:57] you want. At the end of the day, if your [20:59] AI is adding value, it will not care [21:07] do two things today, if I have it right. [21:08] One is um re-engage folks to buy a [21:11] ticket and come to our SAS events right [21:13] in London in December and May next year [21:16] and two reactivate folks to buy [21:20] are we running both [21:23] >> how do you do both at the same time is [21:26] it two different instances two different [21:27] orgs two different iterations and so [21:29] like how many variants of this AISDR are [21:33] are are multitasking are running in [21:34] parallel [21:37] in the first iteration, right? Because [21:40] this was an experiment for us. I I know [21:45] We all agreed we should try this. Um [21:50] a lot of content out there on how to do [21:51] this for real. So, I just started it. I [21:54] was like, ""Okay, let me use the [21:55] marketing principles and sales [21:57] principles I know since the dawn of [21:58] time, but also let me just try different [22:01] things."" So, I started it on three [22:03] different experiments, one for each [22:05] bucket. one which was a totally cold [22:07] outbound literally to a list of people. [22:10] Um it was a mix. Some people knew [22:12] Sasser, some people did not know Saster [22:14] because I wanted to see how the AI would [22:16] do. Then I did um last accounts, right? [22:19] So these are folks that have known [22:23] in a while for sponsorships. And then I [22:25] did then I did one for tickets of people [22:28] who have been to a previous disaster a [22:32] if that would convert. And then fourth [22:34] was I had the website one on in a [22:39] but it was like basically doing some [22:40] light qualifications of folks on the [22:43] website um to see what would happen with [22:46] the AI. [22:48] Yeah, I would say across the board [22:51] results or better or worse in each of [22:54] those four buckets. Probably most [22:56] relevant for folks on this call as [22:58] different product lines. you do have to [23:01] kind of force rank what product lines [23:03] and different campaigns you want to run [23:05] with your AI because already like my [23:07] inbox is out of sense. Like I have, you [23:17] maxed out. And so I literally have David [23:23] segmenting some of the sends through his [23:27] going to use mine for certain campaigns. [23:31] campaigns to work because even the AI [23:34] fast boo is as much as it consent even [23:36] for us was not enough. I was like I [23:42] Before we move on to things like other [23:43] waves in the sales cycle than than pure [23:50] all for you. [23:52] I think when folks turn on or even if [23:54] they make a conscious decision to buy [23:56] something like an artisan or something [24:05] magic for us even at that stage I would [24:10] right everybody has different data [24:12] signal you have different campaigns [24:16] your wish right away of like more [24:18] pipeline more close to one shields more [24:21] reactivated accounts, more sales than [24:23] the way it has for us. Like it may not [24:26] work that way. So just know that going [24:28] into it. Um it will require a lot of [24:31] tuning and training. Um the other [24:35] learning was once we turned this on and [24:37] people started responding to our AI and [24:40] we had a human in the loop which was me [24:42] and it for for a while and and it worked [24:45] the best. You have to respond instantly. [24:47] >> This is a top learning, right? [24:49] >> This is a top learning. I was like, ""Oh, [24:51] because the AI is so good."" The [24:53] expectation is that you literally [24:56] human of a loop and respond, you got to [25:05] like, ""Oh, was this just a bad AI email [25:08] that I got?"" [25:12] hooked up to Slack. Um, and honestly, [25:15] SAS is global, right? So, some of these [25:24] okay, send. Yeah, [25:32] where like mentally you might want to [25:40] else, on top of the humans on your team [25:42] slacking you, the actual emails you get [25:44] from other human beings. Now, your AI is [25:46] like, ""Hey, you should probably respond [25:48] to this person. [25:52] have, or you could send a better [25:53] response than I could, right?"" [25:59] been victim to getting a bad AISDR. [26:01] Everybody at the seminar probably got [26:03] one this morning or in the last 24, 48 [26:05] hours. Um, I think folks are like, I [26:13] kind of seen lately. Either this bucket [26:14] of the AI is going to do magic for me [26:20] if you train it, or the AI is going to [26:23] suck and going to send super generic [26:26] emails, hey, have you heard a disaster [26:30] are like often would never send that [26:35] like these two camps, but if you do it [26:37] the right way and maybe follow some of [26:40] outline, people will get over it. I have [26:45] of the screenshots in this deck, but I [26:47] have many more on my computer in my [26:49] inbox of people being like, I actually [26:53] was you or if it was a mix of both, but [26:58] matter. So like again if you can get [27:01] your AI to be decent to the level of you [27:05] should aim for. They will prefer that to [27:08] you know a [27:10] a or that is one day in at your company [27:14] sending hey have you heard of Zaster? [27:15] would rather get an email from really [27:18] good AI or MIA AI that knows Zaster has [27:23] been a disaster than someone brand new [27:26] product. Like J has talked about this a [27:28] lot. The AI knows the product holds, [27:30] right? Like it knows the product. That [27:36] it up to your product, your pain points, [27:42] that, you know, than pay heavy for a [27:44] disaster. The maybe other biggest [27:47] learning is the AI alone is not enough. [27:50] So, I put it here three times. [27:53] requires a lot of human in the loop. Um, [27:57] I know a lot of the CEOs from the [27:58] different AI companies will say that [28:03] companies, but we know like some of this [28:09] Maybe in a year or so if we can, but [28:11] right now like still at the end of the [28:16] still know the product the best and you [28:17] can tune the AI to get pretty good at [28:19] it. And sometimes the human response [28:21] that I give it is better than what the [28:23] AI response would have been. And so I [28:25] overwrite it like you will tell you, [28:27] hey, do you want to send this response? [28:30] that or you could send more [28:34] and I just send it. So the AI alone is [28:36] is is definitely not enough. you need a [28:38] human in the loop which does take some [28:40] time. So again, lots of things to think [28:46] You got to commit just like you would a [28:49] brand new hire. Like it takes time like [28:53] human, you got to invest that time in [28:58] training, respect, and level you would [29:01] give a human being. Maybe it even needs [29:03] a little bit more respect because it [29:04] knows everything. Um, okay. Few examples [29:10] this email on the left. This is [29:12] literally one we got today, too. [29:19] research. I thought you might be [29:20] familiar with blank our company. This [29:23] person worked at that company. [29:27] This is an example of bad bad the worst. [29:31] Hey, have you heard of SAS or hey, have [29:35] AI do this. All right. If you if this is [29:37] the output your AI gives you, jump in [29:38] and find another tool. Like even with [29:40] only a little bit of data, it should not [29:42] be sending this. I assumed that was an [29:45] AI SDR email. Hopefully not. I I shudder [29:49] to think this guy actually wrote this [29:56] send the email on the left. These are [29:58] screenshots of emails my AISDR sent on [30:02] the right. Um I did three different [30:06] different like three or four different [30:09] using the AISDR4. [30:12] A few different things here. You can see [30:14] it is [30:16] is customizing it based on them and our [30:19] data. One of them is a BC. It talks [30:25] write that email to that dude. Or the [30:27] second one, hey, congrats on your new [30:29] role. It saw that on my dad. had also [30:31] saw from us that they had already been [30:32] to Sasser before but they moved on to a [30:35] email but it found it for me and sent [30:37] them this email about Saster in London. [30:40] These are pretty good. And then from [30:42] here we did a mix of automated responses [30:45] and then human response. The other [30:46] caveat being some of this also [30:50] worked really well because we also still [30:53] did marketing air cover. So like this is [30:58] for you know outbound accounts or [31:01] reactivating lapsed accounts. A lot of [31:04] this was a mix. Like I would go in and [31:06] say, ""Okay, reactivate these LAPs [31:08] renewal account."" But I also still sent [31:11] an email from me personally to some of [31:14] these folks. And then I also still sent [31:16] an email from, you know, Marquetto to [31:18] some of these folks um that was a little [31:22] be as tailored because I was like, I [31:24] already know I have emailed to them. My [31:26] AI has emailed them. And this is a third [31:34] going to turn on Bayr and I could dump [31:38] or fire my whole marketing or fire all [31:43] these are just six kind of combined [31:44] touch points. Three to six for us right [31:46] now has been the right mix. It may end [31:48] up being less I think as the AI gets [31:51] better. This is just additive like this [31:53] has been additive to our journey and [31:58] So just a few other touch points I in [32:01] also this AI journey of you know our AI [32:03] did what calls for us and I was like [32:06] okay uh where else could I plug in the [32:08] AI because now I have these meetings [32:10] bugged you sent all these really great [32:15] the call as a house for us what do you [32:17] do now right as the humans in the loop [32:20] and we still have to get on the call [32:22] with them and you want to basically know [32:24] everything your AI know and and the AI [32:27] knows everything. So I come up with this [32:30] phrase that I call it instead of [32:33] discovery, I call it a working theory. [32:35] So instead of coming to a a call to do [32:37] discovery, you come with a working [32:39] theory, right? You before the call with [32:41] your team, you can do this internally. I [32:43] literally just did this with David [32:44] before a call we had this morning. We [32:46] pre-ressearched them using AI. We made a [32:49] working assumption on who they are and [32:52] what they do and why they might be [32:53] interested in you. Right? You will need [32:55] to do this working theory. more and more [32:58] the more the AI sets up these calls and [33:00] meeting for you because you yourself may [33:03] not know as much about this company as [33:04] your AI does. But if you got the meeting [33:06] for you, the person who comes to the [33:08] Zoom will assume you know what your AI [33:11] knows. And so to match that, you do need [33:20] call. Okay, in chat like did they [33:23] inbound? Did they chat with our AI? Like [33:26] the first C. Claude, use quad and use [33:28] chatbt. Figure out as much as you can [33:32] about this company. Literally ask ask [33:35] claude or ask chatbt right now. Like, [33:39] XYZ company. Why should they buy my [33:42] product? It will tell you. It will tell [33:44] you in 20 seconds. Great. Now, go to [33:46] your CRM. If you can talk to your CRM, [33:49] great. But like look into your CRM and [33:51] say, ""Okay, what has this person done [33:52] with us previously?"" So, just a it just [33:55] is a way to have better calls, but also [34:00] it already knows all this about the [34:02] to do a little bit of human catch up. If [34:05] you also come to the call with a working [34:06] theory, you will need to validate or [34:09] to have a working theory about why they [34:11] maybe want to buy a new product and what [34:13] they might need it for. And maybe you [34:15] know some of their competitors that are [34:16] already using it. Maybe your AI knows [34:18] that. But obviously, you need to [34:20] validate those, right? No company ever [34:22] is going to be like, ""Oh man, so like [34:24] you came to this call like knowing too [34:26] much about our company."" [34:32] already knows everything. You should [34:34] know everything. [34:36] Have a working theory. Think about why [34:38] they might want to use your product. And [34:40] also, you can ask chat. You know, you [34:42] may need to use things like Apollo or [34:44] Seamless or Zoom Info to say, ""Hey, also [34:49] the call? let me do, you know, five [34:51] minutes of research on them, ask it a [34:53] few questions and understand all that [34:55] before they get to the call and then [35:00] recently in the last like two weeks to [35:02] do a working theory and just validate [35:04] those points versus waste 10 to 20 [35:06] minutes on asking the human beings [35:09] questions that one your AI already knows [35:14] this. So catch up to the AI. Okay, last [35:18] couple other things you can use it for. [35:21] Maybe you guys are like overwhelmed [35:22] because I spent so much time talking [35:25] now each new call I have, each new like [35:28] interaction the AI has, what do I do [35:31] with that?"" Push it either about your [35:36] of different tools that do this. I [35:38] listed them here. Some of them do it [35:39] automatically. Um, we use some of these [35:42] tools. I will say each incremental tool [35:45] needs its own training. So the more you [35:47] like start with one, do one thing at a [35:52] not ready to go outbound."" But if you [35:54] want to start small, you can be like, [36:03] going to start using the AI to do [36:04] research on this person before they come [36:09] stone, I would say, too. The AI is [36:10] pretty good at following up cuz not only [36:14] does it know your product goals, it will [36:21] me an email."" Like the ones we use do it [36:24] automatically, but you can also do it [36:26] starting small and say, ""Hey, listen to [36:28] this call. Write me an email to this [36:30] prospect."" It will do it for you. Even [36:34] scan."" If you use the record mode, um, [36:39] not on the web. If you use the desktop [36:41] version of chat GBT to listen to your [36:43] calls, um, one, make sure you have a [36:46] present recorder just because that one [36:52] recording them. But then at the end of [36:54] that, you could ask chat. Like, again, [36:56] this would be a really easy step to [36:57] take. You say, ""Hey, Chat GBT, you just [36:59] listened to that call. What should the [37:00] follow-up email be?"" It will write you a [37:06] generic like perspective. You might have [37:09] a sales proposal you send at the end of [37:11] each call. Um they might ask you for a [37:14] proposal and pricing at the end of each [37:23] company I just talked to. This is the [37:25] pricing I want to give them. Make me a [37:28] customized proposal."" What? It could be [37:30] a one shader. It could be a full-on [37:38] and GenSpark for these kind of as a mix [37:40] with other things like with other things [37:42] we have here too. But this is what this [37:45] is my level expectation of like if I [37:48] were being sold to, this is what I would [37:50] want at the end of my call. like AI can [37:52] make you a fully custom [37:56] boost meeting sales deck to send to this [38:00] person literally in minutes. It does [38:02] take a little bit longer than like chatb [38:04] question, but it does just take a couple [38:06] minutes literally in minutes. It can [38:08] make you this. I send it to them. [38:14] literally a fully custom deck that I did [38:16] not have to go ask a designer for and [38:18] wait two weeks to get back a fully [38:20] custom deck of what we just talked [38:25] Literally, this person on the right was [38:27] a somebody who was known to have some [38:30] interactions with our AI. I did a human [38:32] meeting with them and then asked me for [38:38] to I was like uh I have to go through [38:41] like my photos after a designer. I was [38:48] few photos, which took a couple minutes. [38:50] I uploaded our current options of [38:53] sponsorships, and then I said, ""Hey, [38:54] this is what this person is trying to [38:56] achieve. Can you make them a custom [38:59] slide deck of each of the different [39:00] levels, the pros, the cons, the design [39:05] elements, natural element, like I [39:07] uploaded the goo the image to Google [39:09] Cloud and that was it. and I told it [39:11] what company was interested in custom [39:13] sponsorships. That was all I did. [39:15] >> Bigger organization, your average sales [39:18] rep is just going to download whatever [39:19] piece of collateral they get. [39:21] >> I know [39:23] controls. How would you if you want to [39:26] make that collateral literally an order [39:28] of magnitude better using your workflow? [39:30] How would you scale it? Would you you [39:33] would you have a process break where I I [39:40] you implement it with some sort of [39:42] marketing ops or sales ops support [39:44] because this could be this does like you [39:47] just generated this with AI um but you [39:50] have the assets and you have the domain [39:52] expertise to QA it and make it correct [39:54] right even if it took you 10 minutes. [39:56] >> Sure. Yeah. [39:59] but how would you roll this out if we [40:00] had 20 reps? [40:03] >> Yeah. [40:03] >> There are certain AIs you can use now if [40:06] sales call. It will give you the [40:11] asked for. Like if they asked for [40:12] pricing, if they asked for custom booth [40:14] options, and then I would just make it [40:15] for them. Like I would just take all [40:17] those notes from the AI, [40:19] >> right? [40:19] >> Pop it into either Gamma or Jensburg and [40:22] do it with your own thing and send it [40:26] red so that they have it. [40:28] >> Okay. But this might take you 15 minutes [40:30] to do a good job of today. Would that be [40:31] accurate? Okay. So if if your sales team [40:34] is sending out 50 of these a day [40:36] >> at scale, [40:41] person. So I think you do need an AI [40:43] marketing ops person to do this. [40:47] >> And I also think the other learning I [40:49] think [40:51] library is good enough because a library [40:56] to control it. No, the point is making [40:58] is every single perspectus is dynamic [41:00] and customized to that human. So I I [41:12] you want to have super controlled [41:14] highquality communication with prospects [41:16] you can just let sales reps go free and [41:19] today. So, an interesting thing from all [41:26] now can do 5,000 interactions instead of [41:37] what a lot of folks, especially CMOs [41:40] that I talk to or sometimes CRO that [41:45] less work. They want AI to be less work [41:50] this on even if I need a a day a couple [41:53] hours of training that I hire an agency [42:01] better right [42:02] >> maybe 10 times the product the output [42:05] quality output not just crappy up but [42:09] work managing these AIs right you get [42:11] higher output you get higher quality but [42:16] here that does not seem to exist in high [42:18] quality GTM AI today more work for for [42:21] better output [42:23] >> right you might need less humans so you [42:25] could have less humans [42:26] >> but the ones that you do have are going [42:28] to be working harder. [42:30] But if you want to do what what I think [42:36] component approach is going to get it to [42:38] that level of excellence. Um, but it [42:40] certainly could improve it from a static [42:46] just a learning. [42:46] >> Okay. I think they can get you most of [42:51] it is good, but you still need humans in [42:55] the loop to just do even that better of [42:58] a job with it. Um, [43:05] >> This requires human orchestration. It [43:07] does not require some crappy human or [43:09] agency that reviews the deck and for 5 [43:12] seconds and says great and they flip [43:15] attention. It requires orchestration, [43:17] high quality human orchestration even [43:18] with no other humans in the process to [43:21] create STR output. You need S tier [43:23] orchestration to create S tier output. [43:28] have top tier S tier human [43:35] tier orchestration. Then pick a tool [43:39] think it matters. Like there are we love [43:41] the tools we use, but honestly you could [43:43] pick a slightly worse tool, but if you [43:46] to be dramatically better than what you [43:48] have today, right? The key is investing [43:49] in the orchestration and the QA, right? [43:52] >> Um, and no, no graband-go libraries [44:00] get you there, [44:02] >> right? [44:03] I mean, literally, I was on a demo the [44:06] other day with the head of revenue at an [44:07] AI leader coming up on 100 million [44:10] revenue who did not know what Claude was [44:11] and do not know what MCP was. Okay? And [44:16] content you create for this for him and [44:20] anything. You have to actually go [44:21] further and do it for them with this [44:23] orchestration so that the presentation [44:25] is great. [44:28] I am going through the chat real quick [44:29] to see if any rapid fire questions we [44:31] can answer in our last [44:34] few minutes. Any last things you want to [44:37] wrap on Jason? [44:38] >> I think you hit it. If I summarize all [44:39] the learnings from our own AI for chat [44:42] to SDR to to collateral generation [44:47] is pick a platform, right? Um, and then [44:51] the first like you got you got to tr [44:53] make sure you trained it properly and at [44:54] a most basic level audit it like I say [44:57] but audit it. [45:00] work. Like every day spend an hour and [45:03] read the email. Look at the collateral [45:05] and then sometimes it could be [45:06] frustrating but slow down. Why is it not [45:08] working? Why is it not working? Like we [45:10] had an issue on our little team. One [45:12] person on our team just did not hook up [45:15] their SSO to one of the apps. no matter [45:17] how many times we asked every day said [45:18] it was working and then I made him do it [45:20] live on a Zoom and it finally worked. [45:24] is it not flowing in? Well, he actually [45:25] never actually hooked it said he hooked [45:27] it up never really hooked it up. So like [45:29] every day but read these emails like the [45:31] when we started at at the beginning [45:34] Amelia showed a really dumb AI generated [45:38] to read every one but just do a [45:40] statistical sample. Do what you can get [45:41] through in 30 to 45 minutes each day and [45:43] then take a pause and figure out how to [45:52] multiple platforms. Almost all of them [45:54] can only do one or two workflows. They [45:57] hack it, but learn your tools [45:59] limitations and figure out the next day [46:02] how to make that workflow better. What [46:03] was wrong? What was wrong with why was [46:04] that communication dumb? And then just [46:07] research it. You may not want to. You [46:09] thought maybe you thought AI would do it [46:12] do all the work for you. And then every [46:14] day make your AI better. If you do that [46:17] with what you have. Every day make it [46:22] own or assume you can hire an AI dude to [46:30] for coming. Thanks for watching.",2025-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRIfG6J36d8
"AI Agents as the new Digital Labor force. This fundamental shift redefines enterprise software, creating new competitive moats built on the strategic value of proprietary data.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

10:43 [Sales Leadership, Sales Ops] Create an ""AI Agent Catalog"" or join an existing one like IBM's. Companies can submit their specialized AI agents to the catalog, allowing a large partner sales team (like IBM's) to sell the agent as a use-case specific solution to their enterprise clients, effectively creating a new sales channel. Customers can also self-serve and download agents directly from the catalog (12:01).

16:50 [Leadership] Productize successful internal AI tools for external sale. IBM took its internally-used ""ask HR"" agent and released it as a product that other companies can purchase (16:52). This allows sales teams to sell a proven, pre-built solution, saving customers the time and expense of building it themselves.

22:52 [AE, Sales Ops] Use AI to analyze customer contract repositories to find new revenue opportunities. By pointing AI at all documents in a system like Box, sales teams can ask it to find specific information, such as contracts with non-standard indemnity provisions (22:38) or specific pricing terms that represent an upsell opportunity.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

03:39 The core change from AI is not the user experience (e.g., a chatbot), but a fundamental shift in the ""labor model of using software."" AI enables the creation of ""digital workers"" or agents that can be deployed at scale to automate complex work.

12:22 The nature of a sale is changing from selling software to selling ""digital labor."" Instead of just providing a tool, companies can now sell the entire process or outcome, delivered by AI agents.

13:35 AI can make older, established companies with large datasets and customer bases much more competitive. By layering powerful AI onto their existing assets, incumbents can quickly revitalize their offerings and challenge newer players.

19:53 A company's proprietary data is its most critical asset and the source of a new, powerful moat. Applying AI to this unique data allows a company to create differentiated outcomes that competitors cannot replicate.

24:27 The AI era is defined by an extremely compressed timeline for establishing market leadership. Unlike the cloud shift which took over a decade, companies may only have a two-year window to cement their position before the market platforms get locked in and compounding advantages take over.

33:09 While AI is a disruptive force, the fundamentals of building a long-term business—like iterating on the product and serving customers well—become even more important to separate sustainable companies from ""flash in the pan"" successes.

3.Key Quotes:

12:26 ""It is no longer a software sale. It is not, you know, let me sell software for that process. It is I might actually bring the process to your organization in the form of this digital labor.""

19:50 ""A fun question that that you can start to ask your customers, which is sort of like what data are you sitting on that is proprietary to you? And so thus if you had AI that worked on your data, what would you have as a differentiated outcome relative to your competition?""

24:24 ""You only have you can lose your entire position probably in a 2-year window, but you also have a 2-year window where you could cement your leadership position I I think in a in a very unique and different way.""",Why Enterprise AI Adoption Is Moving 5-10X Faster Than Cloud with Box 's Aaron Levie and IBM's VP AI,"[00:08] Like we like the lowering the reduction [00:11] of of how easy it is to build these [00:15] build one of these things. The thinking [00:18] through the long term of building a [00:19] company and building a franchise [00:21] business over the long run is just very [00:23] different. And I mean IBM has sort of [00:26] proven just like what that takes over [00:28] over you know obviously decades. And so [00:31] so I do think that we will have to [00:34] separate the sheer sort of like holy [00:38] copycats of every single space from the [00:42] for the long run and we we are going to [00:44] keep cranking day in and day out [00:46] iterating building a better product [00:48] better serving our customers. the things [00:50] that transcend AI will become probably [00:52] then even more important. Hey everybody, [00:54] get excited. We just hosted 10,000 of [00:57] you at the Saster annual and AI summit [01:00] in the SFB. It was insane. It was off [01:02] the charts compared to last year. It was [01:04] a deep dive on everything new, [01:06] everything AI, everything go to market. [01:11] Christmas with Saster on December 2nd [01:16] heart of Europe. This is your chance to [01:18] connect with thousands of SAS and AI [01:20] executives, founders, and investors, all [01:22] sharing the secrets to scaling in the [01:26] revenue leader, Saster AAI in London is [01:28] where the future of B2B meets the power [01:31] of AI. And we just announced tickets and [01:34] SasterLondon.com [01:36] to grab your tickets. Saster AAI in [01:38] London, where B2B meets AI and the next [01:41] wave of innovation begins.

Just [01:54] connect your email and Adio instantly [01:55] builds a powerful CRM with every company [02:03] off your first year at atio.com/saster. [02:10] [Music] [02:13] All right. All right. So, uh, all right. [02:16] So, um, thank you everyone for joining. [02:19] Thank you guys. So, Jason decided to [02:23] We just found out 45 seconds ago Jason [02:27] found out last night. Thanks so. All [02:32] off. Yeah. AI agents is probably the [02:34] hottest topic. Yeah. In the entire [02:37] software industry. You guys have been [02:39] early adopters of it. Could you just [02:47] share some story about that. Uh maybe [02:52] an AI agent. [02:55] conference. So Ozo a lot of AI agents [02:59] and I think for us for for everybody [03:01] else probably in software there was this [03:03] moment like two years ago where the [03:05] conversation was okay are we all going [03:07] to have like a chat interface on our [03:08] software. It was the chat should be [03:10] moment of AI and everybody was in this [03:14] mad rush of like should we put put a [03:16] little chat bot should like pop up while [03:19] the kind of you know core user [03:21] experience that was the primary [03:22] conversation and it was a user [03:24] experience conversation it was it was [03:26] more of like an HCI type conversation [03:30] but underneath the hood was like the [03:32] really big idea was forget forget [03:37] user experience of software [03:39] Think about AI as a change to the labor [03:42] model of using the software. So what [03:45] what can you do in a world where you can [03:47] effectively create digital workers that [03:50] can go automate anything you know within [03:52] the confines of of your software? So [03:57] know year plus is how do you turn these [03:59] models especially now with reasoning [04:01] capabilities especially um with tool use [04:04] and and you know better context windows [04:06] for managing objectives. What if we [04:08] could turn these things into agents that [04:09] you can go deploy a hundred times, a [04:11] thousand times, a million times inside [04:13] of your software instance? So for us, [04:17] can do things like read your documents, [04:18] summarize information, extract data from [04:20] documents, automate workflows. We have a [04:23] great partnership with IBM, with Watson [04:24] X where we are bringing model choice to [04:27] our customers, powering things like the [04:29] latest uh Llama models, integrating with [04:32] things like orchestrate. So the whole [04:33] idea is what if you can have agents [04:35] across your enterprise software talk to [04:38] other agents in other enterprise [04:40] software and us I think for all of us as [04:43] an ecosystem this is going to completely [04:44] change what interoperability looks like [04:47] what the future of of building software [04:48] looks like and obviously a lot to [04:51] unpack. Yeah. So you brought up one [04:53] interesting area I would love your [04:55] thoughts on this just for more the [05:00] assistants. Yes. because we saw the era [05:03] of assistance and everything was [05:05] assistance at that point. What makes [05:07] agents different? Yeah, I think I mean [05:09] this is everybody has their own probably [05:10] different nomenclature vocabulary for [05:12] this. We kind of think about it as [05:14] models. [05:18] models or some version of of ML models [05:20] and and then kind of some of the initial [05:22] transformer-based models for the past [05:27] these assistants, things like chatbt, [05:29] etc. are are really kind of these [05:31] assistants you go back and forth with. [05:34] of agents which really fundamentally go [05:35] do work for you. And that work could [05:38] take a minute or it could take an hour [05:39] or it could take a 100 hours for the [05:41] agent. And then in the in in human time [05:43] that could mean, you know, days of work [05:45] or months of work being compressed and [05:49] your software stack to go execute work [05:53] within your software environment. And so [05:55] deep research from open AI perfect [05:57] example of an agent. I want you to go do [05:58] a bunch of research across the web come [06:01] back you know provide an aggregated [06:03] answer for me. And the powerful thing [06:06] unlike a traditional just query with a [06:09] for one second come back with an answer. [06:19] course of actions based on new data that [06:23] to correlate information [06:26] and then go and actually collate it in [06:28] some sort of you know ultimate asset at [06:33] what is becoming possible with agents. [06:36] OpenAI where an agent can actually [06:39] control a browser that becomes [06:41] incredibly powerful. Imagine if you [06:42] could deploy a thousand agents uh in in [06:45] browsers and all of a sudden in the [06:47] cloud you have a thousand browsers [06:48] running with AI agents doing work for [06:50] you. I want to go scrape, you know, data [06:51] from different interfaces. I want to go [06:53] do QA testing on software. I want to be, [06:55] you know, have an agent that acts as a [06:57] security researcher, finding different [06:59] vulnerabilities. So, so we can now [07:01] effectively think about our software as [07:03] having labor attached to it, which for [07:06] all of us building enterprise software [07:08] is like a completely mind-bending, you [07:12] limited by the number of people that we [07:17] building legal software, I can only sell [07:19] to the 10 lawyers inside of a company. [07:21] Now all of a sudden my software comes [07:22] with infinite legal capacity and it [07:25] opens up all new kind of addressable [07:30] conference. Can I ask just a really [07:32] tactical question maybe to both when you [07:33] talk to customer because Aaron you [07:34] talked to so many customers right half [07:36] your week is customers probably 30%. Raj [07:39] at IBM do real world customers do they [07:43] want agents? Do they are they or do they [07:45] just want AI to solve their problem? [07:47] What I worry I know this sounds specific [07:49] and maybe the trains left the station on [07:51] agents, right? But do customers really [07:53] want a thousand agents or do they just [07:55] want are they still learning what AI is [07:58] and I want to talk to my documents. I [07:59] want to solve my problem. Do they really [08:01] want do businesses want a thousand [08:07] they process this. The beauty of agents [08:10] thousands of agents working in the [08:12] background. Yeah. Yeah, but typically [08:20] have disparate systems start talking to [08:22] each other, but you only have one [08:25] example. You know, IBM went down this [08:30] actually been using it internally and [08:32] last week we announced, you know, we [08:34] saved over $3.5 billion internally from [08:37] cost savings because HR functions are [08:40] there, procurement functions are there. [08:43] So every different area that you go down [08:54] the my Watsonx bot essentially for sure. [08:58] Yeah, I think I think you you know [09:01] question and we should probably remove [09:03] you from the stage for for the [09:07] AI agent conversation. Okay, I I [09:11] question like this is this is kind of [09:13] classic Clayton Christensen jobs to be [09:16] done. What what what is your product [09:20] always think about, you know, sort of [09:21] solution product market fit, solution [09:23] fit. And the underlying kind of theory [09:25] of of Clayton Christensen was like we [09:30] we buy effectively, we hire solutions to [09:32] solve our problems. And so what is the [09:36] problem that an enterprise is running [09:39] documents, they want to be able to just [09:41] get, you know, lower risk in their [09:44] customer contract negotiation. They want [09:46] to have better renewal rates. They want, [09:48] you know, more accelerated deal cycles. [09:52] want that as the outcome. And so, [09:54] obviously, you know, collectively for [09:56] all of us, the closer we get to [09:58] conveying those ultimate outcomes, the [10:00] closer we get to pricing towards those [10:03] outcomes, I think that will be the [10:04] natural direction this space goes in. [10:08] agents at least, for lack of a better [10:17] Behind the scenes, you hit it on the [10:21] you know, and I know, but you most [10:26] happening in the back end. You [10:30] we should look at agents because all of [10:32] this is going to be happening in the [10:35] interesting is and and Box was actually [10:36] one of our our first partners to join us [10:39] on this, but we opened up a agent [10:40] catalog last week where companies that [10:43] are creating agents can submit to the [10:46] IBM catalog and then IBM sales teams can [10:51] person shop, you submit your AI agent [10:54] that you built specific for a use case [10:58] that and then the IBM sellers are able [11:02] important especially for the groups that [11:12] been a great partner on this AI journey [11:14] and he you know the moment we talked [11:19] which is legions in size right and they [11:22] are now recently I should know this but [11:27] how many we kicked it off last week okay [11:31] they sell and how do they get smart [11:33] enough about each agent to to sell it? [11:36] So it becomes a use case specific. So if [11:40] is is is not to go industry specific. We [11:43] go horizontal. We want folks that have [11:45] the industry expertise to leverage that. [11:47] So you know as the seller is looking at [11:49] various AI use cases and clients are [11:54] opportunity to say well within our agent [11:58] self-service at one point so even the [12:01] know, if a customer wants to go on there [12:03] and just download it from their the [12:05] catalog essentially, they could start [12:06] leveraging it. But what what what a what [12:08] an interesting time though to be in [12:09] software, right? Just cuz think about [12:11] right what you just kind of said. So IBM [12:13] is going to be going to a bank or an [12:16] energy company or a life sciences [12:22] going to be bringing digital labor to [12:26] software sale. It is not, you know, let [12:31] sell software for that process. It is I [12:33] might actually bring the process to your [12:35] organization in the form of this digital [12:39] of shift the deck chairs [12:46] increasingly look almost like [12:48] professional services companies probably [12:51] out solutions to the customer as opposed [12:54] to just hey use our software hopefully [12:57] you have the people to implement it [12:58] hopefully have the people to even use it [13:00] at your own risk. I think this is a [13:02] fundamental change literally in what [13:04] software is is going to be procured for [13:11] if your AI is very good broadly speaking [13:16] are going to be great okay what is [13:17] really interesting is it can make folks [13:21] IBM has an incredible depth of customer [13:27] I mean incredibly deep and broad box is [13:32] as well. [13:35] You can be older companies like can be [13:38] much better with AI. Yeah, absolutely. [13:42] of IBM, not Watson, but a few parts that [13:44] maybe are a little a little older, but [13:46] if the AI is great, if the agents if I [13:48] can walk in with the box station, you [13:51] sudden that team can be much more more [13:58] um Zenesk is much better than a year [14:05] bored of this company called Gorgeous [14:07] which is like Zenex for e-commerce. Just [14:09] like you have HubSpot. We have HubSpot. [14:11] Shopify is Clavia which is a billion. [14:13] Right? If you go over to that world, the [14:16] gorgeous. Okay. Over there Zenesk used [14:19] to be old. The plugin was a little [14:23] interact with FedEx. So you return. So [14:24] like they want 20,000 customers, right? [14:27] Zenesk probably still creaky under the [14:28] hood, but the AI is bitching. Yep. The [14:31] AI is bitching. So they So Zenesk in one [14:36] comes from the seat reible. We need a [14:39] bitching like benchmark AI benchmark. [14:41] No, we know we need a pitching agent. [14:45] in this vertical, right? But the gap is [14:50] in one month, I might actually have much [14:53] better solutions to sell with these [14:54] agents like overnight it could change. [14:59] We always have to kind of recheck in [15:01] with to our assumptions and and biases [15:05] on what the state-of-the-art is on the [15:06] technology because things that literally [15:08] 3 or 6 months ago were not possible all [15:10] of a sudden become possible. And so we [15:13] like the rate of change in this space [15:20] of good sign. Yeah. I mean if that [15:21] correlates the opposite is worse. Yeah. [15:23] That that is um I mean I kind of enjoyed [15:27] but but my stress is absolutely a [15:30] correlary to how interesting the [15:34] good sign for all of us because it means [15:38] stuff is happening. [15:39] to this exact point you know like what [15:42] you if you go back a year ago the amount [15:46] of work you would have to do to pack [15:50] giving it exactly the right sort of [15:52] context instructions kind of hacking in [15:55] tool use versus today just having 03 go [15:58] do that or having the new Llama 4 go and [16:01] and do that with reasoning capabilities [16:03] you instantly have now caught up [16:05] probably probably an entire a year of [16:08] development from other companies with [16:10] just a single model upgrade now is [16:12] happening. And so it does mean that that [16:17] space. I was going to say like last year [16:19] I think the big buzz word was rag. Yeah. [16:23] but that happened so fast. So fast. [16:26] Right. And the interesting part about [16:28] this is as we look at all these, you [16:32] also providing the capability of if [16:34] companies I saw like 50% raise their [16:36] hand that they were building agents. We [16:38] actually released agent builders last [16:40] week as well, right? And then on top of [16:42] that, we already have pre-built agents. [16:45] So what we used internally are ask HR, [16:50] released that and productized it. So now [16:52] folks can you can actually just purchase [16:54] it versus spending time to build it. So, [17:07] Very good. The text like 1:00 a.m. So, [17:10] yeah, it should it is um it should be [17:12] stressful, right? The rate of change is [17:16] even just take something as simple as [17:20] basically invented the current paradigm [17:22] of of AI coding was obviously the deacto [17:25] standard and let me just do a dangerous [17:28] survey. How many people are using cursor [17:30] or wind surf or replet right now? Yeah. [17:33] Okay. So, like last year it was close to [17:35] it was last year that would have been [17:40] already seeing a kind of a tide change [17:42] in the direction of a new set of of [17:44] startups that are attacking the space. [17:48] environment where nobody can take any of [17:51] fastmoving space. I do think and and [17:57] thinking about from the customers you [18:00] see a pattern of how to have moes begin [18:03] to emerge. The sort of relationship [18:05] between, you know, the agent, the data [18:08] that it works off of, the level of of [18:10] sort of domain specificity of that [18:12] agent, obviously the capability of the [18:14] model, you start to get this dynamic [18:16] where you could have a reinforcing or or [18:19] sort of virtuous cycle of of how do you [18:21] build a moat around what the agent is [18:23] doing. And uh and so because I think one [18:26] existential question for everybody [18:31] you have a sustaining advantage if so [18:33] much of the value is packed in the model [18:35] and to your point about this endes or [18:37] gorgeous you know dynamic like how do [18:39] you make sure that you can have a have a [18:41] position of of strength that you build [18:45] you know have these big questions of [18:46] like okay what does it mean what is the [18:47] new network effect in a world of AI and [18:53] with an agent to create something by [18:55] creating something that data feeds back [19:00] and you get this sort of flywheel that [19:02] that ends up being pretty positive. But [19:05] larger company side. I mean from an [19:09] very interesting is a lot of these [19:11] enterprise companies are actually [19:15] been sitting on this data for many many [19:16] years slowly trying to cleanse it trying [19:18] to figure it out with the adoption of AI [19:22] even companies using their internal data [19:27] seeing that over and over again, right? [19:29] So, I mean, the the beauty of this is [19:31] now you have all of this data that [19:34] lot of the models are built off of [19:35] public data, but how many of these [19:37] models are actually built off of [19:38] enterprise internal data, very limited, [19:41] right? Once we unlock that, I think the [19:48] fun question that that you can start to [19:50] ask your customers, which is sort of [19:53] like what data are you sitting on that [19:54] is proprietary to you? [19:57] And so thus if you had AI that worked on [19:59] your data, what would you have as a [20:01] differentiated outcome relative to your [20:03] competition and very quickly you realize [20:06] more companies are actually in the data [20:08] business or information business than [20:09] they and maybe initially had thought [20:11] about where they start to realize like [20:14] okay actually I do have some proprietary [20:16] information or insight about the real [20:18] estate market or about uh about my the [20:24] agent uh agency or obviously if in [20:27] sitting on a a wealth of data. So, the [20:29] question is if I can bring AI to that [20:31] data, what can I do with that in a [20:33] unique way relative to my competition [20:35] and um and you can kind of like go [20:37] really far with this, which is right now [20:39] as an example, if you look at like a [20:45] the value of their data. [20:52] some, you know, data in the Goodwill [20:55] do that. The question would be the [20:56] question would be in 10 years from now [21:00] will we see this sort of emerge as a [21:02] thing which is like what how good is [21:04] your data as an enterprise? How much [21:06] data do you have? Yeah. Are you actually [21:08] able to turn it into business value? [21:10] Yeah. And AI will be the thing that that [21:12] basically unlocks that because what they [21:15] what AI wants more than anything is more [21:18] thrives on. So, so we will enter this [21:21] com completely new shift and and [21:23] actually like what are the assets in an [21:25] enterprise in a world where you can [21:28] deploy AI agents to to you know have [21:31] completely disproportionate outcomes in [21:34] your organization and I think data is [21:46] of a single I mean you talked to more [21:49] company I work with or know know that [21:53] today. Yeah. If that was the question [21:54] you were asking you tell me some [21:56] examples to me I actually think about [21:58] box as a case study actually we do this [22:00] new podcast I did with Rory from scale I [22:04] anyone that should be benefiting this [22:06] from it I said box and let me tell you [22:08] for a while as you remember right you [22:16] got like forever content box, okay? I [22:19] could never talk to it before AI. So [22:24] wanted to talk to their documents. Now I [22:26] can and and not only can I talk to my [22:30] us now or in 6 months that also means I [22:33] can do stuff I never thought I could do [22:34] with my like the initial case study is [22:36] okay tell me everything in box where I [22:38] have the wrong indemnity provision. You [22:40] start there and then all of a sudden you [22:41] can talk tell me what contracts I [22:45] contracts had lacked authority. Tell me [22:47] where like the designs are off on the [22:49] measurement on and so or just tell me [22:52] where I could have an upsell opportunity [22:56] pricing that that maybe you know you you [22:58] be you have a better position for that [23:00] uplift that the the value your moat [23:07] turn this into a Wall Street conference [23:08] but yes the that happens faster some [23:13] of our remote, but the um but I think [23:16] the big question is what is the value [23:17] inside of of your data for any [23:20] software, find ways to get the customer [23:26] very bullish right now. You know, [23:30] like these AI coding tools, you can just [23:35] Twitter or X or whatever. I I think the [23:37] mode is is actually fantastic because if [23:41] that understand your codebase, they [23:43] understand your development [23:44] methodologies, they understand your [23:45] documentation, they understand your [23:47] specs, that is something that becomes [23:49] this ongoing flywheel that just gets [23:51] bigger and bigger and bigger. That will [23:53] be true of every single segment in [23:55] healthcare. Imagine if you under if [23:59] particular set of patients and the [24:01] particular sort of practice areas of [24:05] going to want to swat swap out that AI [24:07] system. So for as fast as everything is [24:09] moving and as disruptive as everything [24:12] window in the next couple of years where [24:16] platforms get built and effectively [24:19] cemented assuming that they stay [24:24] right? you only have you can lose your [24:27] entire position probably in a 2-year [24:31] point where you could cement your [24:32] leadership position I I think in a in a [24:35] in a very unique and different way where [24:43] there was a 5year period where people [24:46] could just kind of fuss around like [24:52] years later 15 years later basically [24:56] platforms all at massive scale. People [24:58] had time to kind of figure it out. AI is [25:01] probably not going to look like that. [25:03] locked in and compound [25:06] so fast. But I get I want to believe [25:14] going to figure out. [25:17] ask him. He just shows up on our panel. [25:27] this data lock, right? But if my MCP is [25:29] great, yeah, maybe I just grab those box [25:31] files and that data and I abstract away [25:34] box and sure box has the data and the [25:35] healthcare company, but if I can talk to [25:37] it through a myriad of different levels [25:39] and MCPs and everything, is it really a [25:42] moat? I would actually argue that MCP is [25:46] a thing that only enhances the the [25:48] underlying mode because data wants to be [25:53] moat around managing the data and making [25:55] it useful. It wants to be incorporated [25:57] in some other workflow. So for us, the [25:59] more places where customers can use [26:01] their data is only a net positive. We [26:04] want to connect to every MCP, you know, [26:08] tool and that just makes the continued [26:11] feedback loop of having more data at [26:13] least in our environment more valuable [26:16] to be accessible from all these other [26:18] systems. So I think of that as kind of [26:21] the the analogy would be like did APIs [26:25] actually in many cases made companies [26:27] more sticky over time because they could [26:29] be embedded into even more software [26:31] which made that even a greater level of [26:33] of sort of concentration. So, so I I [26:35] think I mean I I see no reason why MCPs [26:40] the APIs that we built over the past [26:42] couple of decades. Yeah. I was also [26:44] going to just say that one other aspect [26:54] opportunity for all of these companies [26:55] cuz then you have the ability once [27:03] upsell in the marketplace where [27:05] companies are able to raise their prices [27:07] because of these AI capabilities, but [27:15] less than two years that we see this [27:18] thousandx faster than the cloud adoption [27:23] start using it you know in probably in [27:26] high school doing homework you know and [27:38] easily the fastest adopted technology in [27:44] know any of their published metrics [27:45] somewhere what 500 million active users [27:47] some something on that order of [27:48] magnitude in two two and a half years [27:54] something like that because first of all [27:55] in in every other technology [27:58] have enough people wired up on the [28:00] internet to put those kind of numbers. [28:04] obviously correct and so so think about [28:09] are being wired completely differently. [28:15] college know somebody in college maybe [28:16] just graduated college. I I was speaking [28:21] like these these kids are like I want to [28:25] be a little bit like old man yells at [28:26] cloud kind of thing but or you get off [28:30] of like amazed by how it works but like [28:40] workforce but they work so differently. [28:45] our enterprises and be like, ""Wait a [28:46] second."" Like you take 2 weeks to come [28:50] up with a project plan for some [28:52] marketing strategy. Like literally that [28:55] thing was just spit out by Claude in 5 [28:57] seconds. Why would you meet about that? [29:01] work the way we work? And obviously [29:07] break. But like think about an entire [29:09] onslaught of a of a new generation that [29:12] is just like why would you spend time [29:15] reinventing the wheel [29:23] the marketing plan you want. Just do the [29:28] going to see such a rapid change is you [29:30] have a new workforce entering you know [29:32] every organization. You have boards and [29:34] CEOs and governments saying like, ""Holy [29:36] crap, we got it. We have to move [29:40] this, but but every customer that we [29:42] talk to, if I compare it to, [29:50] terms, think about 08 and 09 pitching [29:56] Okay. Okay. So, like that was a [29:58] non-starter. Like that was like not a [30:00] conversation you would have. If they had [30:01] to keep all the data on premise in the [30:05] contemplate this. Get out of my office. [30:06] Yep. Probably that that still persisted [30:09] to the mid 20 2010s. I would have [30:11] meetings with banks that that were [30:14] deploy our first couple use cases. So [30:19] you could meet with today where they [30:26] are our AI principles. That is not [30:28] happening in these big companies. So [30:31] so probably to your point like it will [30:33] move way faster [30:35] than cloud and and that timeline is [30:37] going to shrink in a in a pretty [30:49] Literally, we had Yamini from was here [30:59] pretty far ahead. If you look at where [31:00] like if you look at all the peer groups [31:04] stress then yeah we all got Yeah. And [31:08] she said our core is strong. Okay. Our [31:10] core is and it is it gets stronger and [31:12] stronger right but the thousand small [31:15] competitors are better than ever. Yeah. [31:19] mo the core mode is there right? The [31:22] core mode is there, but if you get [31:23] nibbled away at the end, if you get [31:25] nibbled away because the big guys get [31:29] have two small competitors. Now you have [31:34] one feature like in the old days. Now [31:36] the thousand are cool because you can [31:39] talk to them and they can talk to your [31:40] data and they can MCP into box. And so [31:43] now you have a thousand really good [31:44] competitors, not two crappy ones, right? [31:47] I hope them our votes are getting [31:52] getting weaker. I agree. I guess the [31:54] thing that that the only counter, but I [31:56] think anybody at this conference is will [32:00] probably actually endorse my point. If [32:06] you want to be sustainable that you want [32:11] coding a a Salesforce competitor like [32:13] one night and be like, ""Okay, but maybe [32:14] three of you are, so sorry."" But more [32:16] than you think, actually. Fine. Fine. [32:28] Like we like the lowering the reduction [32:31] of of how easy it is to build these [32:34] build one of these things. The thinking [32:37] through the long term of building a [32:39] company and building a franchise [32:40] business over the long run is just very [32:43] different. And I mean IBM has sort of [32:45] proven just like what that takes over [32:47] over you know obviously decades. And so [32:50] so I do think that we will have to [32:53] separate the sheer sort of like holy [32:57] copycats of every single space from the [33:02] for the long run and we we are going to [33:04] keep cranking day in and day out [33:06] iterating building a better product [33:07] better serving our customers. The things [33:09] that transcend AI will become probably [33:12] then even more important. Yeah, because [33:14] they they will be the things that [33:15] separate the sort of flash in the pan, [33:18] you know, overnight success that then [33:22] really in it for the right reasons or [33:26] do they actually get to scale. So, and [33:34] able to have an established base, yes, [33:36] box for example, now you put you guys [33:40] move pretty fast on the AI piece. Now [33:44] becoming remote because you do have all [33:46] of these documents. you have access to [33:51] okay so what do we do though when when [33:59] but I am I am optimistic that these [34:01] things end up compounding because the [34:04] better company ends up getting the more [34:06] customers ends up building then the next [34:10] think AI has finally changed the [34:12] calculus of that as long as the team is [34:14] sort of in it and building for the long [34:17] a slightly funny story from this event [34:19] ties to both [34:21] college and kids and generation. So, uh, [34:23] we had we had a we had like a kickoff [34:25] party that IBM sponsored on Monday night [34:26] before we started and my daughter is a [34:44] built an AI sales agent to do research a [34:48] ARR. Wow. I want to get to five by the [34:51] summer and I want to go more mid-market. [34:57] AI. Wow. And 20% of my class has already [35:06] hole. Is he worried? Is he worried that [35:08] he needs to build a giant sales team? He [35:11] had to to take 8 years to get to 2 [35:15] in 2 years. But and then he can call us [35:18] advice. It was just the craziest story [35:22] many little things in disruption, right? [35:24] How much you could do with that, how [35:25] quickly you could grow and the lack of [35:30] incumbent fear, right? No fear, right? [35:40] but that begs the question of cuz my [35:45] next year, but what do you end up [35:47] studying now with AI, right? Like, you [35:49] know, before is you know, you knew [35:50] computer science was going to happen, [35:54] like you want to be like you probably [35:55] want to be like 15 years old right now, [35:59] right? Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We want [36:01] you need enough people to go in the [36:02] front lines and sort of figure it out. [36:04] Like I think may maybe your son right is [36:10] Okay. Always [36:13] but I mean what an incredible time right [36:15] and I do think I do think that these [36:16] this generation has a leg up because of [36:21] the future. Yeah. This is what it looks [36:23] like. And you can go and enter companies [36:25] and just be like ta this is how I do [36:27] things. I remember my first internship I [36:30] got like some of the most like random [36:33] probably strategic projects because I [36:35] just like was like better at the [36:36] internet than the other people and so so [36:43] just better at AI than every one of my [36:51] into the workforce in this next [36:53] generation. Absolutely. All right. So, I [36:59] that? You were at the first Saster. [37:03] Saster. Yes. Yeah. But hopefully not, [37:09] right? Okay. Okay. It was one week after [37:13] the box IPO. You might not remember, but [37:14] I remembered viscerally. Those were wild [37:16] times. You were the kindest gentleman in [37:19] but coming one week. Anything for a [37:21] document OG. So, yeah. Awesome. Thank [37:29] stage yet. You got security back there. [37:32] All right.",2025-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbbfATqzuLw
The AI-Native CRO. A playbook for building systems-driven sales teams and managing the new hybrid workforce of humans and AI agents.,"1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

3:40 [Leadership] To drive AI adoption, leaders should personally use AI tools (like Clay or ChatGPT for leadership tasks) and share their specific workflows in leadership channels to set an example.
6:31 [Leadership/Hiring] When interviewing any leadership candidate, ask: ""What are you doing with AI? What do you know about it? How are you using it today?"" to screen for AI-native and curious individuals.
8:14 [Sales Ops/Leadership] Hire a dedicated ""GTM AI Lead"" within the RevOps team to own and centralize AI automation, preventing individual reps from inefficiently experimenting with multiple tools.
10:23 [Sales Ops] Implement a tool like Momentum to automate CRM data entry and quality control. It can be configured to analyze call transcripts, run custom prompts to fill Salesforce fields, and automatically ping a manager in Slack if a rep says something that deviates from the methodology.
15:15 [Leadership/Sales Ops] To improve manager effectiveness, conduct a ""zero-based"" calendar audit. Wipe every recurring meeting off the calendar and rebuild the schedule from scratch, prioritizing high-value activities like coaching and using AI to make audit mechanisms more efficient.
32:53 [Sales/Support Ops] To improve an AI support bot, create a continuous feedback loop. When a ticket is escalated to a human, analyze why the bot failed, create a new knowledge base article to address the gap, and feed it back into the system. This will incrementally increase the bot's containment rate.
34:17 [Sales Ops] Instead of using a separate AI knowledge tool, leverage the AI capabilities within your existing knowledge base (e.g., Guru). Turn on its features to automatically capture information from Slack conversations and turn it into knowledge base suggestions for continuous improvement.
48:44 [Sales Ops] Automate call audits using a tool like Momentum. Instead of manually listening to calls, write a prompt that runs across all call transcripts, extracts the relevant information, populates a Salesforce field, and sends a Slack notification for review.
49:21 [Leadership/Procurement] When selecting AI vendors, push for pilots and performance-based trials. Do not make large upfront commitments, as the real value and challenges are discovered during implementation.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

4:18 Sales leaders must be hands-on with AI tools themselves, because if they are not, their competitors will achieve a 3-4x efficiency advantage.
5:21 Any sales team member who is not ""deeply curious"" and actively experimenting with AI by mid-2024 is a liability and should be removed from the organization.
18:21 The portion of the sales team that is just ""order taking"" will be replaced by AI, which can answer questions and process transactions, freeing up humans for higher-value activities.
23:50 AI will blur the lines between self-serve, commercial, and mid-market sales. It will enable a fluid customer journey where a buyer can move between a bot, a human, and a product-led experience seamlessly.
28:01 AI will create a greater bifurcation in sales performance. It will raise the floor for low-performing reps, but it will give the most significant advantage to the top performers, making them even more effective and valuable.
40:34 The mediocre BDR role focused on qualification will be eliminated within a year. An AI is already better at answering detailed prospect questions instantly and is preferred by buyers over being ""qualified"" by a human.
53:25 To survive, CROs must become ""highly systems engineering focused."" The old model of a CRO who is just a good people manager will not work; they must be able to design and orchestrate a complex system of humans, AI, and infrastructure.

3.Key Quotes:

5:16 ""If on anyone on your executive team or honestly I know this is tough love anyone on your team that by June 30 is not deeply curious... I would like just taking the blacking to the org chart because they had their chance, right?""
25:02 ""Is it to hit your sales number or is it to build enterprise value? You should be optimizing for a significant equity outcome. And so I think this reorientation around this like more holistic understanding of building a business is I think going to be really important.""
53:56 ""That version of a CRO will not survive in this era. You need to be able to think in systems.""","AI, Sales + GTM in 2025/2026: This Changes Everything with Jason Lemkin and Owner CRO Kyle Norton","[00:00] So, you just said two [00:01] things that I think are super important [00:04] and the theme of the opener yesterday [00:06] tough love statement because what you [00:07] just said I think is so important is [00:08] that you as the CRO a are in the tools [00:18] hiring especially that you have is not [00:20] in the tools and worse not curious, are [00:26] right? [00:30] Hey, are you tired of listening to hours [00:32] and hours of sales calls? Recording is [00:36] game. Attention.com unleashes an army of [00:38] AI sales agents that autoupdate your [00:41] CRM, build custom sales decks, spot [00:43] cross-ell signals, and score calls even [00:46] before the coffee is cold. Even before [00:47] the coffee is cold. Teams like Bamboo HR [00:50] and Scale AI already automate their [00:52] sales and revops using customer [00:53] conversations. Step into the future at [00:55] attention.com/saster. [00:59] Thank you to the early bird. Very kind [01:02] day three. Somehow by day three 9:00 [01:06] becomes very early. Kyle, thanks for [01:08] coming. Thanks for having me. A little [01:09] background, maybe it maybe a month or a [01:12] half ago, we do a Saster Workshop [01:14] Wednesday where we do a live meetup. I [01:16] did a version of this AI and how sales [01:19] is changing a month ago and I went to [01:20] redo it and so much has changed in one [01:22] month. [01:24] So, I want to talk through where I [01:30] probably seen Kyle before. He is a CR of [01:32] owner which just raised at a billion [01:35] dollar valuation the other day. This [01:37] week, Tuesday, you announced it just for [01:38] SAS. Tuesday. Tuesday. A billion dollar [01:40] valuation. So, congratulations to Kyle. [01:43] But even better, Kyle was close to the [01:45] first meeting and you were not the first [01:46] person in sales, but you probably joined [01:49] around a millionish of revenue, right? [01:51] Two and two. Two. And in fact, he joined [01:54] incredible founders. You can watch all [01:56] the stuff on SAS, but maybe even while [01:58] the company was in transition, right? [01:59] Your first couple months might not have [02:01] even been the easiest, the smoothest [02:02] ones, right? And several stages. So, [02:07] Kyle do something. Two things that are [02:09] germanine to this conversation. One is [02:15] restaurants that do not read email, [02:18] okay? That do not do this The ACV [02:22] approaching 10K. But this is a hard [02:27] sale to tiny business and vertical SAS [02:29] that do not buy software that are not [02:31] looking for things to bolt on to [02:33] Salesforce or HubSpot that probably [02:37] And Kyle has crushed it in general. So, [02:40] we could do a whole section on the [02:41] secrets, but then Kyle is just very [02:47] sales. And so whatever AI is today in [02:49] sales, but to be more interesting where [02:52] think of someone better to join the [02:53] conversation. So is that a good bit of [03:01] to my team that this has to be a mission [03:07] a bunch of stuff I want to talk about, [03:08] but when you said mandate for your team, [03:11] because this is a question we got even [03:13] to Yammen yesterday, what does that [03:14] mean? How do you show the team the path [03:16] forward for AI and sales? It has to [03:23] most well-versed in this area of the [03:26] business. And I think I find a genuine [03:33] conviction that this is going to be the [03:34] most important thing that we can figure [03:36] out in the next 12 to 24 months. And so [03:40] into our leadership channels, my [03:43] personal clay workflows or the chat GPT [03:47] projects like that I use individually [03:49] for me as a leader. And I take a lot of [03:52] demos. I talk to a lot of founders. I [03:55] listen to a lot of content to try to [03:57] stay on the cutting edge with it because [04:02] 30, 60, 90 days. And the riskreward is [04:06] so big that it takes up a lot of my mind [04:08] share. So you just said two [04:11] things that I think are super important [04:13] and the theme of the opener yesterday [04:16] tough love statement because what you [04:17] just said I think is so important is [04:18] that you as the CRO a are in the tools [04:28] hiring especially that you have is not [04:30] in the tools and worse not curious are [04:36] right yeah because the competitive [04:38] pressure is so great if you are not [04:41] making this a mission critical priority [04:44] your competitor is and if you look at [04:47] the gap in productivity between us and [04:52] can spend so much more money on a per [04:55] person basis than anybody else we [04:56] compete with in marketing in post sales [04:59] because our machine is anywhere between [05:02] three and four times more efficient on a [05:04] per rep basis. Yeah, I want to come [05:07] thatund 1.5x 3 to 4x is pretty big. I [05:12] cooked right. I genuinely think and that [05:16] if on anyone on your executive team or [05:18] honestly I know this is tough love [05:21] anyone on your team that by June 30 is [05:24] not deeply curious like is not [05:27] pretending to use chat GPT once a week [05:29] to get recipes your team should be both [05:32] scared and a kid in a candy store. a kid [05:35] in a candy sir if your team is not this [05:37] is effing cool right every week I use a [05:40] new tool right and I was slow I for and [05:42] I want to talk about this I was into AI [05:44] as a student but until we launched our [05:46] SAS again I said we had 130,000 chats in [05:51] mean I was using but now I use brand new [05:53] tools every day like all the little [05:54] videos I made I use this app called [05:57] Hicksfield AI which is super cool like a [05:59] lot of the design this was done on AI [06:02] our design we have a the best designer [06:03] in the world but this whole idea was [06:09] the hallways and talking in the weekends [06:12] and on Slack about this cool what you [06:15] can do in AI and GDM, GTM, I think at [06:17] least I give them till June 30. By June [06:20] 30, if not if July 1, I would like just [06:25] taking the blacking to the orc chart [06:27] because they had their chance, right? [06:29] done this from a hiring perspective. [06:31] anybody in leadership. So in any [06:37] doing with AI? What do you know about [06:38] it? How are you using it today? And I [06:45] and what I consider to be AI native. [06:50] halfdrafted Tobyesque letter for my [06:53] team. Yeah. Toby from Shopify who wrote [06:55] a letter to all of Shopify about how [07:00] drafted the same thing for my management [07:09] vibe coding my own apps for internal use [07:18] windsurf I took one Python course in [07:20] early 2023 when chatyppt was blowing up [07:22] just to learn a little bit about it but [07:25] now with windsurf I can legitimately so [07:29] got it all set up so that I can actually [07:34] stuff out of the lever API to run [07:38] do you can do so much more if you put [07:40] your mind to it. And that maybe you [07:50] interviewing an AE or an SDR today and [07:53] remind me the ratio of like general [07:54] outbound to inbounded owner, but when [08:03] Yeah, because we are running an SMB [08:04] motion and so most of the automation and [08:14] GTMai lead. So, somebody who will do [08:16] nothing but this within the RevOps [08:20] need the reps in a bunch of tools [08:22] messing around. Okay. But, do they need [08:24] to be AI curious? [08:28] I think long-term they should, but for [08:34] an enterprise rep, absolutely. But for [08:39] sell between work and the CRM [08:47] hiring one to threeyear [08:49] tenur reps on the UPS slope of their [08:55] recreating the system. They need to [08:56] operate within my system and execute the [08:58] methodology, but for the betterment of [09:00] their career prospects, yeah, they [09:03] should be trying to learn it themselves. [09:06] sense to me and I want to ask you then, [09:08] what stack do they walk into today? [09:14] years of experience, right? They could [09:17] average, right? I wonder if the ones you [09:20] okay. Two to three more years. the kids [09:22] today that are graduating high school or [09:29] man. Yeah. And we talk I talk about it a [09:33] lot across the team. So, I do hope to [09:44] degree of proficiency to just default to [09:52] think that person is going to scale with [09:54] the chance. All right. Okay. So, help us [09:59] years of experience. What do I walk [10:01] into? And does that mean I can do more [10:02] meetings, more calls, more outreach, [10:04] more texts? Like how does that what do I [10:06] walk into and how does that 3 to you [10:13] to 4x so what do I walk into and how [10:17] very low bar for some of our competitors [10:20] Salesforce is the foundation then on top [10:23] of that we use momentum for automated [10:26] CRM enrichment and you can basically do [10:29] whatever you want with momentum it can [10:31] look at call transcripts run custom [10:34] prompts fill in the Salesforce field run [10:36] an automation, ping somebody in Slack, [10:39] you said the wrong thing on a deal, [10:40] something that we know is the wrong [10:44] and the rep and be like, Jason said this [10:49] can correct it before the deal closes. [10:51] So momentum is the foundation for a [10:52] bunch of our a bunch of our automation [11:00] of being on sales calls and following up [11:03] and generating revenue every single [11:07] gone [11:13] in terms of the revenue generating [11:20] update the notes for the launch team. [11:25] that a top KPI getting that above 30% [11:27] time in deals? I would like the RGA time [11:33] them 25 to 30% more revenue generating [11:36] activity time. And how many I remember [11:38] back in the day when Brex was taking off [11:41] and Sam was really into efficiency preI. [11:45] goal was at least four four to be [11:47] automation state of 2021 was the rep [11:51] would walk in with four four [11:52] appointments on their calendar for them. [11:58] demos a day. Still similar number. [12:00] Three. He I think Sam talks about it. [12:04] to get to four demos. Three held cuz [12:08] nutrition rate. And then probably two [12:11] follow-ups and then a healthy amount of [12:17] bit of pipeline generation but actually [12:18] not much on the AE side. Yep. And then [12:21] the call prep, call followup, CRM, [12:27] talk about AI and followup. You probably [12:30] I told this story of this and I wrote a [12:32] Sster post on great AI outreach, [12:35] terrible follow-up. I did see this. Did [12:40] like a week ago, I literally got the [12:44] our podcast and video, like this [12:56] today. And it was like and this is [12:58] exact. And here are my clients just like [12:59] Sasser that will do it. And this is a [13:09] I was in and then he sends a follow-up [13:11] email. What is Saster doing and how many [13:13] podcasts have you done? Yeah. Rough. [13:17] Okay. Yeah. And then yesterday, I told [13:20] I want to hear your learn. Yesterday, I [13:23] the follow-up. Yesterday morning, I got [13:25] an email from a well-known B2B company. [13:30] week. Would you like to meet next week? [13:34] Yeah. Hey, Jason, I know you might be [13:35] busy. So many flaws in that. Yes, I [13:37] might be busy. Two, this is the worst [13:39] week to meet me of all the 50 weeks of [13:41] the year, but next week. Okay. So, then [13:43] I email him back. Worst outbound ever. I [13:49] not upset. I just want to see. And then [13:50] the guy writes back, ""This is what [13:52] happens with bad AI automation."" Yeah, I [13:54] got one of these recently, too. Did you [13:55] get one of them, too? Maybe the same [13:59] think this is when you have people [14:02] trying to apply AI for the sake of it, [14:06] customer journey, the entire thing. But [14:08] how do you do that owner? So, owner like [14:10] restaurants do not suffer fools. I have [14:13] expensive. Yeah. So, how does that how [14:16] great. I have a great RevOps leader who [14:18] is very fluent in sales and the actual [14:22] go to market fundamentals. I think I see [14:24] this mistake where you have RevOps [14:26] people investigating tools and then [14:30] thought of okay, how does this get to a [14:32] rep? How do they follow up? How does the [14:38] what I call the management intelligence [14:40] layer, which is what is the always on [14:43] layer for the manager to understand [14:47] and get prompted when things are either [14:50] off base or off track and so that they [14:52] can nudge the rep back into track back [14:54] onto what they should be doing. And so [15:01] the how does the calendar of the manager [15:03] look and how does that integrate with [15:08] we we spent 8 weeks at the beginning of [15:10] the year redeploying what I call my like [15:12] core operating methodology. And so we [15:15] wiped every single meeting off of the [15:16] calendar, started from a zero base and [15:18] said, ""Okay, what are the most important [15:20] activities? Coaching is number one. [15:27] then how do you make the audit [15:29] mechanisms as efficient and effective as [15:34] what does the business outcome need to [15:36] look like and then layering in AI to [15:38] accelerate all those things. Not saying [15:41] okay I want to use AI for this thing and [15:43] then trying to fit your business into [15:50] orchestrating the entire business and [15:53] then using AI as a leverage point as [15:58] to the future a little bit before I I [16:00] need I should know this quest the answer [16:04] typical sales cycle at owner and how [16:06] many interactions on average does it [16:07] take until you close a restaurant? A lot [16:09] of one call closes one closes sub 7day [16:12] sales cycle. Okay. And so the first [16:15] touch point will be a BDR or an SDR [16:18] following up. They book a meeting. They [16:20] do a confirmation call and then demo [16:23] happens. Lots of calls closed on that. [16:29] that follow-up call, the win rate falls [16:34] worth talking about what happens after [16:35] that. So the demo may be a good [16:37] challenge to this little tweet I have. [16:39] But I still want to this is still what I [16:40] think is going to happen a lot. I wrote [16:45] hallucinates. April 2025, maybe an okay [16:48] rep, right? Yeah. And then April 2026, [16:52] our AI is better than 80% of reps. I [16:54] want to hear what you think about that. [16:55] And then I pulled this. Clary just [16:57] published this data. All maybe you saw [17:00] it too, right? I always knew this, but [17:04] think was like a million opportunities [17:05] or something. The top 10% of reps close [17:07] 65% of deals. Yeah. I know you have an a [17:10] a world-class team, but for these one [17:12] call [17:13] closes, especially when the customer is [17:19] when everyone has used owner, do I [17:21] really need a mediocre sales rep or can [17:22] AI close that deal in a year? We are [17:26] augmenting reps with AI and not trying [17:29] to replace as much. But we are building [17:30] a PLG motion that will be heavily AI. [17:42] and that will deliver a lot of the sales [17:49] on the website, build problem awareness, [17:51] book meetings, answer a bunch of [17:53] questions. And me as a buyer, I had a [17:56] lot of conviction about this one mind [17:58] investment because as a buyer, I was [18:00] going to their superhuman and asking a [18:01] bunch of questions. How does it [18:02] integrate? How does it do this? And I [18:04] was like, okay, this will work. Yeah. [18:08] restaurant buyer is going to be as [18:10] interested in that experience as I was. [18:13] But that will do a lot of the sales [18:18] is a part of the sales team that is [18:21] really just order taking and they are [18:27] me make you feel special. Answer a [18:29] couple questions. Swipe a card. Swipe a [18:30] card. I do believe that the superhuman [18:32] will take some portion of people all the [18:38] also building a customer journey that is [18:43] trying to build what I call [18:45] semi-selfserve which is yep a consistent [18:48] customer journey that has different [18:50] channels, different experience channels. [18:52] You can come onto the website, talk to [18:53] the superhuman, you can talk to a rep, [18:54] you can go through the productled [18:59] your walk through and asynchronous [19:02] demos. And what we want to build because [19:05] where I see people go wrong sometimes is [19:08] a way for a buyer to go through that [19:10] journey, interact in the ways that they [19:12] want and not get locked into this [19:14] attribution problem or these silos where [19:26] should be an automated spectrum, right? [19:28] You should get whatever version from PLG [19:30] to handheld sales that I want that the [19:37] going to pay a sales commission on this [19:42] trying to think holistically about the [19:44] business, holistically about that [19:46] customer journey and let people go back [19:48] and forth, channel to channel, [19:51] going to close them wherever we want. [19:53] And so you could have a rep that is a [19:55] recent BDR promote that is [19:59] closing 50 deals in a month at a 910k [20:02] ACV because people are coming to them [20:07] need to squabble over definitely you [20:12] you worst case you got to double pay for [20:14] a while. The AI you got to pay the human [20:19] done a hybrid premium self-s serve, this [20:21] is not this is pre AAI. You got to do [20:22] it. If you get cheap on this, it creates [20:23] too many conflicts. But it was [20:28] going to close these deals 100%. But [20:30] then you have PLG. So you already have a [20:32] continuum. In a year or two, owner will [20:35] be deep into nine figures in revenue and [20:40] already used owner before. Yeah. And but [20:43] they went to a they went they that [20:45] restaurant shut down or they got a new [20:46] job. Yeah, they might not want to talk [20:48] to a person. Especially if the product [20:51] has a flexible contract, especially if [20:56] moved to a New Mexican restaurant in [20:58] Orange County. New point of sale. Do you [21:00] Yeah. Do you integrate with it? Do you [21:01] integrate with I got three questions. [21:06] on your team might be better than a [21:07] human. So that that it could be a [21:10] material number of deals closing a year, [21:14] Yeah, it will. Right. Yeah. [21:16] And it gives your team leverage to do [21:19] higher and higher value activities, go [21:21] after bigger, more complex customers. [21:23] The same thing with the onboarding team. [21:27] leverage AI to automate a ton of what [21:33] replace a whole ton of them. Although we [21:35] will definitely slow the headcount [21:39] so many high lever things that we could [21:41] do with a customer in onboarding. teach [21:43] them how to use the product better, make [21:46] enabled when they launch owner to [21:49] celebrate it with their customers and do [21:52] the capacity to do some of that stuff [21:54] now, but once you start to to automate a [21:58] ton of the more wrote tasks that we do [22:00] with people now, then you can move [22:02] people to a higher order activity. I [22:04] think yeah, let me ask a specific [22:07] than me at every level, co-founder Jer, [22:09] but he said many times what he thinks is [22:11] going to happen is AI is going to lead [22:12] to more less specialization in sales, [22:14] more generalization. I think the [22:16] opposite and I but I mean this specific [22:19] interesting background. I think what may [22:21] happen with AI sales teams is you may [22:23] just have a demo team. You can call them [22:25] sales, but if the one thing you need a [22:27] human and an owner is that S tier demo, [22:30] maybe the AI does everything. It [22:32] seamlessly grabs a person not next week [22:34] when their calendar is free, but right [22:37] A human does whatever demo needs and [22:40] then digital Jason can take over the [22:42] rest if they want or I can, right? But [22:44] you might have these interesting, you [22:46] might have this human part of on [22:47] boarding where you need a little bit of [22:49] human a human demo and then this human [22:52] help me. I need more help than the AI. [22:53] But then those might be like hyper [22:55] specialized rather than hypereneralized. [22:57] I I certainly lean here. This is we get [23:00] into this big debate about the full [23:03] rep because I believe much more in [23:06] prospect. Cold calling is hard. Unless [23:12] And so I am a big believer in [23:14] specialization. And similar to you, how [23:17] do we think about where we apply the [23:19] most expensive human capital to specific [23:21] parts of the customer journey? Yeah. But [23:25] to ask you a follow up on this before [23:26] this one. One learning I had from you, I [23:30] think AI in sales, I have a slide later [23:34] lead to a big renaissance in [23:36] self-serving PLG because if you want an [23:40] three-year contract arguing over [23:41] discounts and terms. The AI has to be [23:43] able to close it with zero friction, no [23:48] your point I think is even more [23:50] thoughtful which is that it may blur all [23:52] the lines the lines between self-s serve [23:55] commercial mid-market maybe not deal [23:58] size but all the ways right now we have [24:00] different teams interacting with [24:11]  deal so why do I have to be [24:18] all the experience be fluent whether I [24:19] self-s serve little help a lot of help [24:21] and so it may blur all these lines [24:23] between the different categories right I [24:29] anti-attribution in general like I think [24:31] we get into problems where we say oh [24:33] this is a marketing attributed sourced [24:35] deal versus a sales attributed one end [24:37] up making the local maxima decisions as [24:40] opposed to saying all right how do we [24:42] maximize this entire system and the [24:51] growth team that reports into product [24:55] taking sales as deals. I a CRO said this [24:58] to me like a couple days ago. They were [25:02] Is it to hit your sales number or is it [25:04] to build enterprise value? You should [25:09] for a significant equity outcome. And so [25:13] around this like more holistic [25:15] understanding of building a business is [25:16] I think going to be really important [25:18] going to see these silly silos where [25:28] this but I think by the end of next [25:30] year a point that everyone from Yam [25:36] better and better tooling. We added [25:37] sales loft and outreach and gong, but [25:39] sales reps still close the same 3 to [25:46] whatever. I think AI is not only going [25:48] to boost that up, like your point. I [25:51] because of attribution is commissions [25:53] are going to have by the end of next [26:00] closing the deal without you. Yeah. [26:02] Okay. But if that doubles the output of [26:04] your org inherently the instead of [26:06] whatever you take home 10% overall 15 [26:11] everything whatever your patch is team [26:14] but I think commissions will have to [26:15] have as part of this definitely I think [26:18] where there will be some pressure the [26:20] other way is for the best sellers if you [26:23] have an elite mid-market and enterprise [26:25] seller they will have so much more [26:27] leverage with all of these tools that [26:29] the competitive dynamic will say it was [26:32] only that seller was worth 350K to me [26:38] grand for that person to pull them from [26:40] somewhere else. And the best might make [26:41] more, right? One way or the other, the [26:43] best might make more, right? I think so. [26:46] next point. But then let me Okay, so [26:57] since the beginning, like most of the [27:00] way or the other, right? [27:02] What about the guys we just talked [27:03] about? The one that says sasters next [27:05] week, the do they honestly between us, [27:08] do they have a job next year in this new [27:10] world? Do they have a job? That mediocre [27:12] rep working 15 hours a week from home [27:16] with three side hustles, mostly working [27:17] on their ADU and their Airbnb. This was [27:19] everyone in [27:22] they have a job next year. I think most [27:30] going to go to your class at Pavilion [27:33] and the next week wake up and be like, [27:35] ""Okay, I want to work 50 hours a week on [27:36] this AI enabled sales life."" Yeah. [27:43] Would I make a $100,000 bet on it? Like [27:47] one. So, you just closed a billion [27:51] to one. I might give you 10 to one if [27:52] you want. So, I agree with you very [27:54] much. I think AI will contribute much [28:01] research that showed that AI for call [28:04] center teams raised the floor [28:05] significantly and most of the gains were [28:07] attributed to the lowest performing [28:10] individuals. It brought low performers [28:12] up to a better standard. But in the [28:14] world of PhD research, AI was actually [28:17] making the best researchers even better. [28:20] So the gains were going to the most [28:22] sophisticated people in that craft. [28:24] Yeah, I think in many parts of sales [28:28] it become an even bigger bifurcation and [28:33] you want to work 20 30 hours a week yeah [28:39] for a long time one of the best sale in [28:43] emailed me this week while I was here my [28:47] my next role got any good ideas and I [28:50] emailed him back have you gone to the [28:52] fund website do you even know what [29:04] had multiple roles where he was in the [29:11] shorts okay since the very beginning now [29:15] then I was like I remember when he was [29:18] guy that works from home in shorts but [29:19] he crushed it he crushed it but man that [29:24] the middle of in the middle of faster. [29:37] knowing him. I I definitely lean in your [29:43] difficult market to survive in if you [29:48] are out there trying to figure out the [29:52] big of a dislocation since the beginning [29:55] of the AI acceleration tool era and I [30:00] was super early. I was like one of the [30:02] first sales cadence customers. Kyle [30:04] Porter onboarded me himself and we got [30:06] like a 5x leverage on a per BDR basis. [30:10] The BDR team I inherited was like a [30:11] dumpster fire. But all we had to do was [30:14] some better training and we gave them [30:15] this tool that nobody else was using and [30:17] we still used that like predictable [30:21] the person that does this and people [30:22] would respond to that email and tell you [30:24] the person and then you forward it. That [30:27] the competitive advantage we got then [30:30] was so significant that it changed the [30:32] trajectory of companies. And the same [30:41] be really painful. And some of this will [30:46] to do it. And so thinking about how to [30:48] do it most thoughtfully and be ahead of [30:50] the curve, things have never been more [30:53] difficult, I would think. Yeah. So this [30:56] one I think we hit this slide you but [30:58] feel free to add on top of it. This is [30:59] this is actually a slide from Gorgeous. [31:02] 20,000 more and more more AIdriven [31:05] contact centers and e-commerce in the [31:06] Shopify ecosystem that Kyle knows. And [31:13] Intercom, others in there. And this is [31:14] this was this is from a couple months [31:17] color blind but the big the bar charts [31:19] are what everyone says AI does. All [31:21] their marketing sites say 60%. And these [31:24] were the actual numbers based on a third [31:25] party study they paid for. Okay. So on [31:29] a delta between the marketing claims and [31:32] reality but also this but it but none of [31:37] seeing in the contact center is yes some [31:40] of the claims are a little aggressive [31:41] right but folks are laying off 25 30% of [31:45] their teams not to just to save money [31:47] but because the AI is better and the AI [31:58] cares who cares if digital Kyle solves [32:01] my freaking problem because I got the [32:03] wrong watch when I ordered it online who [32:05] cares but this is disruptive and I think [32:10] here next year this is going to start to [32:19] folks self-s serve half of it is done by [32:22] like this next year for sales 100%. [32:25] Yeah. Then I think where you see people [32:28] are going wrong right now, they go, ""Oh, [32:34] So we use too much. We hear that. So we [32:36] use Crescendo for support automation and [32:42] like, you know, you you expect AI is [32:44] going to be this like miraculous thing. [32:45] And it was like okay, but our knowledge [32:47] base was crappy at the time. Yeah. And [32:50] it would be really easy to be like, oh, [32:53] But then every week we produce 4 to 10 [32:57] new knowledgebased articles and that AI [32:59] containment that bot containment rate [33:01] jumps 3% 4% 6% and now like almost 50% [33:05] of our tier one support tickets are AI [33:11] AI made us realize that some [33:13] deficiencies in how we were managing [33:15] support and so you just have to be [33:18] betting on the future because that will [33:24] bunch of tier 2 and then what we use [33:27] real support people for will be like [33:29] very sophisticated stuff that that you [33:31] need more highly trained folks for. So I [33:35] everywhere just so you started and then [33:40] going to explain how it really works but [33:44] upload enough of your documentation you [33:45] thought we uploaded everything we [33:50] magically work out of the box so you [33:52] added more did you do QA did you see [33:55] mistakes and update and interact yeah [34:00] Crescendo and their team and we go [34:01] through what what needed to be escalated [34:04] to a person and why and should that have [34:06] been bought contained. We go, ""Oh, [34:08] that explains how this is done."" Even [34:10] though our support team might know how [34:12] to do it. So then, but then they just go [34:13] add to training every week. Yeah. And [34:15] information. It just gets better, right? [34:17] Yeah. Through guru. So we looked at a [34:20] bunch of like knowledgebased AI stuff [34:26] the beginning. Super smart, the CEO [34:29] of a company who could have been [34:32] massively disrupted, but they went all [34:34] in really fast. And we looked at a bunch [34:37] ""Oh, the best tool is the one we have. [34:38] We just need to turn it on."" And so now [34:42] that into a knowledgebased suggestion. [34:44] We do a quick the knowledge team does a [34:48] knowledge base, it gets picked up on the [34:51] flywheel now of issue identification, [34:55] content creation, deployment, and that [35:01] stories, but just to tie it together, if [35:05] the chat bubbler in the middle of the [35:08] trained. It took about a day to train it [35:10] on 17.8 million words of content. And it [35:12] was pretty good. And already was great [35:14] because maybe it had more content than [35:16] your knowledge base. It has 12 years of [35:17] SAS content, very specific. And then [35:19] once in a while and then I read as many [35:21] of them as I can and once in a while it [35:22] and I tell you what I learned [35:24] specifically the mistakes it makes. So [35:28] So I for and I enjoy it. I like it like [35:29] you did. I like this stuff. Right. So [35:32] in the morning I see what the handful of [35:35] mistakes it makes a couple percent and I [35:37] just go and I change it. It literally [35:40] in two minutes. The only real [35:41] hallucination it did, and it is [35:43] interesting, is for Saster Europe, it [35:46] kept telling everybody the wrong date [35:48] for this year. And why did it do it? We [35:50] have, and maybe Darra can explain to us [35:52] how the ragging and vagging and [35:56] the date online. So, it was guessing. [36:00] guess the same, which is interesting. [36:02] in London in September."" Sometimes it [36:06] different dates. And I saw it a couple [36:09] train thing. It took me 5 seconds and I [36:15] first week of December and the next day [36:17] next time. So if just keep doing [36:19] improving it. It this is the thing [36:23] If your AI is great out of the box great [36:27] lot better than zero but just every just [36:29] improve it. Pick a platform. It [36:34] And just commit to making it better [36:38] it is in 8 weeks. Right. Yeah. 8 weeks [36:42] know if I blame the vendors for this or [36:45] the buyers, but everybody expects it to [36:47] just work out of the box and this [36:52] work. And we had the advantage at owner [36:55] of being a very disciplined [36:57] documentation culture. And so like we [37:00] use this company called Avara as an AI [37:05] coach, but I write a lot and because I [37:10] everybody to have written documentation [37:12] of all the things that we want to teach [37:14] you. And so when we got stood up with [37:17] it, it very quickly did a pretty great [37:19] job of mimicking not a generic [37:22] challenger style or sand. This is my [37:29] advantage that it was already done. But [37:31] I think the buyers of these tools need [37:34] to understand that you need to go do a [37:37] bunch of the foundation work to create [37:40] the content and tweak it every single [37:45] mind sim like on a every other day just [37:48] doing sims and filling up the [37:53] leverage is so significant. I know that [37:56] every hour I spend there, the [37:58] incremental leverage of now this thing [38:00] getting in front of thousands of website [38:02] visitors every single week. You got to [38:08] Yeah. People some of it to the prior [38:12] clear. But last SAS angel last one was [38:14] not a year ago. It was only in September [38:16] and everyone laughed about AIS. Okay. [38:18] Tomas Tongas came and said he did the [38:21] survey and no one could get them to [38:24] did it on our LinkedIn poll. We had [38:25] 3,000 folks. Only 2% folks said they get [38:30] I missed the point. Yeah, I missed the [38:32] point that faster day SDRs do work. In [38:35] fact, the stories I just told it. Yam [38:40] just you got to know what the tool can [38:44] better. But expecting that the lazy [38:46] approach to AI is also death. Yeah. The [38:54] You got to be in it all the time. Maybe [38:58] what how we train our AIs in two years [38:59] is probably nothing like today, but [39:02] Yeah. And maybe our AI will train our [39:07] managing a bunch of people and a bunch [39:12] a different type of work, but it needs [39:15] all of this, but I want to hear you as a [39:17] case study on a few of the points that [39:23] has the quality of team of owner, but I [39:25] said AI for us, this is what I learned [39:27] from our AI is already better than [39:30] of qualification. The average kid coming [39:36] know how to spell owner, that has done [39:39] owner, but man, it happens. It happens [39:45] did for us is we have a perspectus for [39:50] but then we have this docu 100 pages [39:52] that Ameilia has developed on [39:53] everything. How can I get ice cream in [39:58] right on our little team of three? They [40:02] stuck it in our AI through Deli and the [40:04] next day could answer all the questions. [40:05] Mhm. And it started and then it answered [40:07] all the related questions and then it [40:09] difference between a silver booth and a [40:13] and then all of a sudden it was better [40:16] detail. Yeah. that amount of de you [40:18] cannot you can only expect so many [40:21] ice cream cone I can have in a silver [40:23] booth and what time do I have to show up [40:24] and how many leads will I get and it [40:26] said on average you get 218 leads for [40:29] never met a BDR this good and I think so [40:31] my view and challenge this I think the [40:34] mediocre BDR in a year will be out of [40:37] these BDRs that when you reach out I [40:40] think a website should be an AI should [40:41] be able to qualify and no one likes to [40:43] be qualified [40:44] I hate being I can smell the [40:46] qualification [40:50] see the need at all for this qualifi not [40:52] outbound but this qualifying BDR very [40:55] much in the future I think for a ton of [41:00] some niche cases where you have a [41:03] prospect that really wants to talk to a [41:06] really interesting to see the pickup [41:08] rate of our one mind superhuman with a [41:12] restaurant buyer that is not very [41:29] better than me. And so I think for Yeah. [41:32] I think for at least by volume at least [41:37] impossible. And so I think for most [41:40] markets this is very true. I think the [41:42] SE thing is a great use case. Yeah, you [41:45] have these AIES that can join a Zoom [41:47] call, answer questions which are when [41:52] compelling, but then there are the [41:54] solutions engineers that are great at [41:56] asking the really incisive business [41:58] questions and have worked with a bunch [42:00] of similar customers and there will be [42:09] this be better? Yeah. The other thing [42:10] what everyone again and then let me I [42:12] just want to pick one related thing to [42:15] get your thoughts on. This is one of my [42:16] top learnings from RAI from these [42:18] conversations is that people there and [42:21] for a lot of reasons will prefer to talk [42:25] wants to talk to a bot. I think bot [42:27] people still use this term bot. I would [42:29] banish it because bot is like IVR. It [42:31] just has negative maybe Darl will [42:33] disagree. I just think it for me it has [42:34] negative connotations. The last thing I [42:37] forced to talk to a crappy bot. Okay. [42:44] awesome. Thanks for doing People. This [42:51] awesome. Again, thank you. Great help. [42:53] Thank you. I would rather, especially [42:59] scheduled. I would rather talk to this S [43:01] tier AI and it knows the product cold. [43:04] So, I want your thoughts in general, but [43:14] people person, Kyle. And people like to [43:16] talk to people. [43:17] Now, people like to talk to the best [43:19] solution architect in the world that [43:21] also deployed my product, even if we [43:25] helped me get going at my my buddy down [43:27] the street. And this is David, and he [43:29] did it. I want to talk to David. Yeah. [43:31] But this idea that you can be a people [43:32] person and not be a product savant in [43:37] who won the NBA finals. Yeah. Hey buddy. [43:49] think being a people person and not [43:51] knowing owner helps you close a deal? [43:52] No. No. Absolutely not. But most sales [43:55] great people persons. Many do. Many do. [43:58] And a challenger would tell you, the [44:00] challenger sales book will tell you that [44:02] profile is actually one of the worst [44:03] performing profiles out there. And what [44:08] challenger. Somebody who can teach, [44:09] tailor, and take control. Teach means [44:11] you know the market, you know the [44:12] product. Tailor, I can really listen to [44:14] you. So I can do both. Yeah. Going to [44:18] can do that too. Yeah. It can I think it [44:20] can do the best first two better than [44:22] 90% of humans going to that first point [44:24] from if you build it the right way. I [44:29] this. I had almost no help. Amazing. I [44:34] I had an hour of help. Really? This is [44:36] the point people are missing. The Deli [44:41] a little frustrated at the time. In all [44:42] fairness, I got about an hour of help [44:44] just because I had a little trouble with [44:45] the ingestion. I got no help after that. [44:48] Maybe in the background I got a little [45:00] it. Not no one on the team. What? Good [45:04] the tools in Deli is cool, but all the [45:12] The This is I think a lot of sales tools [45:14] are not as good as Windsurf and they [45:17] should be. Yeah. When sales tool, this [45:18] is my view. The only reason sales tools [45:30] an if a bunch of S tier like the best in [45:33] going to build an AE. Not all the other [45:36] stuff. Not discovery, analysis, [45:42] and me are going to hire the three best [45:43] engineers out of OpenAI and Windsurf. [45:45] And we are going to build a complete AE, [45:47] not a partial AE. Okay, I think we could [45:50] do it and I think it would blow. I think [46:03] Be the wind surf of your category, you [46:05] will run away. I think I agree. I very [46:07] much agree with that. Maybe owners a [46:08] little bit of that. Yeah. I think that [46:10] in restaurants a little bit. Yeah. I [46:14] that so many of my CRO friends have is [46:18] trying to figure out who to choose and [46:24] great demo but a really bad [46:28] people in every single category and so [46:30] you got this sort of paralysis and so [46:31] you have to be quite good at picking [46:34] these early stage winners. If you want [46:38] had the advantage of doing a bunch of [46:40] angel and being involved in some venture [46:41] funds and following it very closely. So, [46:50] that have that like A+ upside that have [46:53] a really sharp opinion on the market and [46:55] have probably done it before. And so, [47:01] momentum is winning in their category. [47:05] product at a ridiculous rate and I think [47:10] tools and I see a lot of people choosing [47:13] this like the most random things coming [47:17] this question a lot. What should I use? [47:19] Yeah, cuz it is confusing. My meta [47:24] copy someone you respect, whoever it is. [47:28] It could be it but talk to someone you [47:29] respect. Copy it and then go in with [47:31] five but measured expectations. Go in [47:34] and do not expect magic but do not [47:36] expect it to be magical immediately. [47:41] tool you pick guru deli whatever tool [47:44] artisan which is very cool all of them [47:46] ampar and then every week you got to [47:47] invest. Yeah. You have to invest for [47:49] real and you and this is going to make [47:51] sos and cos have to be much more [47:53] technical not engineers but much more [47:57] every whatever platform you pick is [48:00] immature, but invest in it, improve it [48:03] each week, and then the magic is going [48:05] to your point. If you have a high [48:06] velocity team, the product itself will [48:11] with Deli, like when we launched this 2 [48:14] okay, for whatever reasons. Then it [48:16] added it and now founders have uploaded [48:18] like hundreds of decks for VC. Give me [48:20] feedback on my board slides. Give me [48:23] do anything. It just added it, right? [48:24] So, if you invest in a platform and the [48:26] team is high velocity, every month it [48:28] will get better, too. But you got to [48:34] lot. And you have to be really committed [48:36] to making it work. You got to put the [48:37] resources behind it. And as a CRO, like [48:40] you have to consistently push people on [48:42] it. The amount of times I have said in [48:44] Slack, use momentum for that. Somebody [48:46] will be talking about, oh, we audited 20 [48:50] like, what are you doing? Use momentum. [48:52] You just write a prompt, run it on every [48:53] single call that ever happens, stuff it [48:55] into a Salesforce field, get a Slack [49:00] hard on so many things now the muscle is [49:02] there for people to be to have an idea [49:06] about revops of building that into [49:07] momentum. It takes 20 minutes yeah to do [49:10] and so you have to put in the work to [49:12] set it up right and tune it but then [49:14] also consistently push adoption down to [49:19] about picking vendors is push for [49:21] pilots. Push for somebody to show you [49:48] there is so much in the implementation. [49:58] into all of these tools we have. But [50:00] basically everything else I said this is [50:04] not making any commitments up front and [50:09] channel hard. Tell me about some [50:11] customers and then go talk to them and [50:13] get the real feedback. You got to be [50:15] really choiceful because you waste a lot [50:16] of time with the wrong tool. Yep. All [50:19] right. Let me I want to dig into one or [50:20] two things for run of time. We talked [50:21] about this one to two call closes. You [50:25] starting to agree with me. It might be [50:26] 50%. As we go on, depends on the time [50:29] horizon. It will be 50%, is that in 6 [50:32] months, 12 months, 24 months? It it is [50:33] an eventuality. Yeah. Let me ask you [50:40] in yellow or green or whatever it is. [50:42] Maybe I said CRO and CRO, but I also [50:44] mean RevOps. I think this year to be a [50:47] revops professional imminently in a CRO [50:51] by the end of this year you will have to [50:53] know how to manage a 50/50 team 50% AI [50:56] 50% human not just tools but you will [51:00] have to learn how to manage agents [51:08] extended team this is PLG 2.0 0 on [51:11] steroids, right? Your team may be half [51:20] better know how to manage this hybrid [51:22] team of humans and AIs. It sounded crazy [51:26] know this year. Will the CRO need to do [51:31] this can you have in your RevOps team? [51:36] the agent management is going to happen [51:42] bunch of things that I want to do that [51:46] RevOps, but I want somebody to own this. [51:48] And so is all of the agent management [51:51] happen is can we put that in one [51:53] function cuz they will do it so well [51:54] that there will be so much more [51:58] actively trying to answer this question. [52:00] I mean, I hope so. I worry though is if [52:02] the CRO or VP of sales job is to hire [52:05] Janette that is my AI revops person. [52:12] written about like the 100% failure [52:15] rate. Yeah. New VP of sales CRO comes in [52:17] only done inbound only done whenever. [52:23] outbound that then hires 11 SDRs off the [52:26] street in one week and it never works. [52:30] hard to do it out of the gate. So if [52:37] gonna ask, how are you going to manage a [52:55] AI is an agent. Now I I have a different [52:58] into but yeah a lot of my job is done [53:02] through AI. So am I managing agents [53:04] today? Sure you could call it that but I [53:07] think the point remains a lot of your [53:09] job is going to be through AI workflows [53:12] and agentic services and managing all of [53:16] these [53:17] tools. A lot of my job is managing the [53:19] system and infrastructure of our [53:21] business anyways. And so the same thing [53:23] called by another name. I think the [53:25] point is you need to be a highly systems [53:30] engineering focused CRO to survive over [53:32] the next two to five to 10 years. If you [53:38] understand how customer journey connects [53:40] to systems and infrastructure and [53:43] connects to the rep process and how this [53:45] whole orchestration works, you will [53:56] a good manager, people like me. That [53:58] version of a CRO will not survive in [54:00] this era. You need to be able to think [54:02] in systems. Maybe maybe the polyiana [54:07] what happens is the another possible [54:11] just shrinks. Okay. So imagine for your [54:13] revenue in a year 40% sold closed by an [54:16] AI salesperson and 60% is by the sales [54:19] team. Maybe instead of the CR having to [54:22] maybe the role just shrinks right and [54:24] and certainly like in the B TOC side [54:28] the low end of owner in some ways that [54:29] happened because marketing does much [54:31] more and more of if in the B TOC side if [54:33] marketing can just run the campaign and [54:41] right is that a dated skill set just [54:45] have to manage your AI team and your [54:48] human team Yeah, I agree. Which is [54:51] a tool to manage an AI team and a human [54:53] team, right? There will be a bifurcation [54:57] AI native really quickly, your role will [54:59] shrink and then this will get done [55:01] elsewhere. If you can become AI native, [55:02] then your role as a CRO will contain [55:04] that. I spend a lot of time on PLG. I [55:06] spend a lot of time on on this whole [55:07] thing. So, my role has grown. If [55:16] Okay, last one. And we touched on all [55:18] this other stuff. It was great. Th this [55:20] is my view that people think is kooky. I [55:27] product which is in the next X months. [55:31] noteaker like Granola, Janola, Otter. We [55:34] do these workshop Wednesdays this year. [55:41] helps. Right? I think a digital SE like [55:47] Deli is going to come to the zooms. [55:52] person is going to be there and I [55:54] brought this up and Darra said give me [55:55] another release and this will be full [55:59] together but this person is going to be [56:01] there should be there on all the Zooms [56:03] at least as an SE. Yeah. Like as good as [56:07] Adam the CEO digital digital Kyle should [56:09] be here. that is you but better because [56:12] you know everything in the product. This [56:15] humanlike version should show up. I [56:17] think this is soon and will change the [56:19] whole way we do Zooms in sales. This is [56:22] doing this right. Not a noteaker, not [56:24] someone to send a chat, a literally a [56:30] than a human as an SE, right? Yeah. And [56:33] can be activated when called upon and [56:36] also proactively jump in. What I would [56:38] like is when a sales rep says something [56:48] going to be proactive. I think this only [56:53] call and they listen. And then you ask [56:57] integration works. And digital Brian [56:59] jumps in. This is exactly how it works. [57:05] choose. It will be on everyone like a [57:07] notetaker. Absolutely. The will not be [57:10] choosing it owner. It will be there. [57:13] in the coming months. Thanks, my friend. [57:15] Thanks everybody.",2025-05-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oLxWRF9Uys
An engineer's playbook for marketing. Learn how a product-leader-turned-CMO used deep audience understanding and custom AI tools to make a technical security brand go viral.,"1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

0:47 [Sales Ops / Sales Enablement] Build a custom internal GPT, like a ""spell checker,"" to ensure all outbound communication is technically accurate and aligns with the company's brand and tone of voice. This tool can be used by every single person in the organization, including AEs and SDRs, by having them paste their customer emails or other communications into it for a quick check. (25:03)
13:02 [Sales Leadership] Restructure the organization by moving the Field Marketing function and its budget from the Marketing org to report directly to the Sales org. This creates tighter alignment between field marketers and their regional sales directors, as their success is directly tied to the happiness of the sales leader they support. (18:03)
18:28 [Sales Leadership] When hiring a field marketer for a specific region, ask the regional sales director, ""Have you worked with somebody you liked before?"" and then try to hire that person. This ensures immediate alignment and a strong working relationship from day one.
22:27 [Sales Leadership] In quarterly team meetings, require every person to present what they are doing with AI. This forces the entire team to continuously explore and adopt AI tools, upskilling them and fostering a culture of curiosity and efficiency.
30:20 [Sales Leadership / Marketing] For B2B enterprise sales, identify the primary social media platform where your executive buyers (e.g., CISOs on LinkedIn) are active. Track the growth of your company's followers and engagement on that platform as a key brand and awareness metric, aiming for exponential (e.g., 20% quarter-over-quarter) growth.
11:02 [SDR / Marketing] To engage a technical audience, create and release complex, gamified challenges that teach them a hands-on skill (e.g., ""security riddles"" or coding challenges). This provides genuine value, builds brand credibility with expert users, and helps you stand out from generic content.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

23:04 AI acts as a massive force multiplier for top talent. A ""superstar"" employee can now accomplish an endless amount of work, but AI does not replace the need for these amazing, superstar people.
00:16 The most important trait for success in the AI era is not deep domain expertise but being ""extremely curious"" and having a ""get the job done"" personality, as the tools and landscape are changing constantly. (24:20)
28:31 The bar for performance has been raised significantly because mediocrity is now easy to automate. Customers are smarter, and sales professionals must be smarter than their customers to add value. (27:50)
25:54 The specific tools used for sales and marketing are becoming obsolete in cycles as short as six months, making adaptability and a hunger to learn new things more critical than mastery of any single tool. (01:19)
00:50 AI enables the creation of simple, scalable internal tools that can enforce complex standards like technical accuracy and brand voice across an entire go-to-market organization, something that was previously impossible to do effectively. (25:48)

3.Key Quotes:

15:09 ""At the end of the day I work for the sales team. I do. I work for the sales team.""
28:31 ""Mediocracy now is not hard to automate.""
23:00 ""I think a superstar can do so many things and now a superstar can do really endless amount of things.""",Marketing in the Age of AI with Wiz's CMO Raaz Herzberg,"[00:02] I want to be humble here and say like I [00:07] to share my perspective [00:09] I think when I say superstar I never [00:12] thought about it from being you know a [00:14] super hyper domain expert but rather [00:16] being a person that is extremely curious [00:20] and just gets the job done and I think [00:22] that type of personality thrives right [00:24] now in the AI landscape. One of the [00:27] things that CML I did a lot because [00:29] again the product is so like the domain [00:31] is so technical and one of the things I [00:32] was that was so important for me is that [00:34] every security person that reads [00:35] something or hears something that comes [00:37] out of whiz is like oh yeah like they [00:41] spend so much of my time like reviewing [00:45] like accurately technical. Now I built [00:47] like a super easy GPT that we call like [00:50] the whiz spell checker that is used by [00:53] every single person in the organization. [00:56] like according to our brand and tone of [00:58] voice. Like you write the customer [00:59] email, you put it there. Technically [01:01] accurate, users are right to your bones. [01:03] So [01:04] >> it checks every customer communication. [01:08] super fan. [01:08] >> It helps you like write everything, [01:10] right? But I still believe that at the [01:12] end of the day, the people who are most [01:13] successful are hungry and curious [01:15] people. Cuz to your point, I really [01:19] used 6 months ago are not the tools I [01:21] use today. [01:26] Hey everybody, the bests are taken or [01:30] overpriced. I was literally looking for [01:32] a domain name the other day. It was [01:33] $10,000 just to make an offer. So, you [01:35] settle on a workaround domain for your [01:39] cleansharp.te [01:41] domain that instantly says is a tech [01:43] startup. Grab yours at get.te/saster. [01:50] or on domain registers like GoDaddy. [01:52] Stop compromising. Get the domain you [01:54] need. Hey everybody, Sasser Annual will [02:00] SAS and AI gathering for executives.

[02:44] Raz. lot of topics to get into, but we [02:48] will start with a quick background and [02:54] got Roz Heber. She is the CMO of Whiz. [02:58] Roz, thanks for joining us today. [03:01] >> Thank you for having me. Great to have [03:05] background formally, maybe you read it a [03:07] little bit with the announcement of the [03:10] Google intent to buy Whiz, but for those [03:13] appointed CMO of Whiz with a product [03:17] background. So, no prior experience in [03:19] marketing. Just by way of introduction. [03:22] How did that go? Like, how did that [03:25] actually work? Just as like I feel like [03:32] for projects like being the CMO at whiz [03:35] was my first marketing role. At the time [03:38] I joined Whiz is um one of like the [03:40] first five employees and I joined as a [03:42] first product role and for the first two [03:44] and a half years of whiz I led the [03:46] product organization and I still [03:48] remember the day that our CEO of staff [03:50] asked me to kind of take over the [03:52] marketing function and my answer was [03:54] like no. What are you talking about? I [03:57] mean just to put it into context I have [04:00] never been on a go to market org before [04:02] right like I was always on the [04:03] engineering side [04:06] I did not know the first thing about [04:08] marketing I mean when I took the role I [04:10] have never heard the term MQL or I knew [04:15] what pipeline was but like very high [04:19] or PR agency like nothing what I did [04:22] know was I knew our business inside out [04:24] so like building the product for the [04:26] first two two and a half years. [04:29] What I did was you know work with [04:31] customers from the beginning. I sold to [04:33] a lot of customers in some ways like I [04:35] helped shape the selling process and [04:38] list like I helped you know what is the [04:40] first step what does a successful POB [04:42] look like. I knew the customers and the [04:44] product and our business inside out but [04:47] I knew nothing about marketing. I mean, [04:50] Liz blew up, right? I mean, but in [04:52] general, I think it did like one to 100 [04:54] in 18 months or 20 months or something [04:56] like that. How did you as an engineer [04:59] turned marketing, what like data set did [05:01] you focus on initially? Like what did [05:04] is what can I optimize, right? What can [05:08] seeing this more and more often, more [05:10] and more folks are approaching marketing [05:11] from an engineering perspective. So, [05:13] what were the first couple things you [05:14] attacked? I think not knowing marketing [05:16] really shaped the way I came to think [05:18] about it because I knew exactly what I [05:21] was trying to solve. Our problem at that [05:24] time was nobody heard of whis at all. [05:27] Nobody heard of W. We had great product [05:29] market fit, right? But what would happen [05:31] to us is we would meet a customer, [05:34] meet a customer and we would, you know, [05:37] have a great first meeting and they [05:38] would be like, ""Oh my god, this looks so [05:39] good. I wish I heard about it like 3 [05:41] months ago when I just signed with one [05:43] of your competitors. They did not know [05:48] we know that had he heard of us had we [05:51] been part of that process we believe [05:54] that he would have bought whiz right so [05:55] our pain point was nobody heard of whis [05:58] so I did not know anything about [06:00] marketing but I came into was like okay [06:03] what are all the things I can do to [06:05] solve that problem I just want the right [06:08] person like I want security buyers with [06:10] a security product I want security [06:12] buyers I want cyber security buyers ers [06:14] to hear about whiz and ideally know that [06:17] whis does cloud security so that if they [06:20] need something for cloud security they [06:21] think of whiz. That was the problem I [06:23] said to solve. I was not focused on [06:25] building pipeline because I did not even [06:26] know I was supposed to be focused on [06:28] that. I was just like thinking in terms [06:29] of how do I solve this problem as fast [06:31] as I can whatever it takes. [06:38] brought up um and something we talk a [06:40] lot on Saster I know Jason has some [06:43] takes on this as well is how technical [06:46] do you need to be right so with this is [06:48] a fairly technical product obviously you [06:50] had you had more of the technical [06:52] background than maybe a more traditional [06:54] CMO would have had like how do you feel [06:57] like that also helped make it work right [07:00] and then how did you maybe evolve that [07:02] to say okay now that I know I have to [07:04] own this marketing function how Can I [07:07] actually make that exciting because [07:08] security is a little bit traditionally a [07:10] bit more boring than selling like a [07:13] marketing or now an AI piece of [07:17] question. So again, I go back to like [07:19] the core problem. Nobody heard of us. Um [07:22] and so my solution to that was making it [07:25] exciting. Like I wanted to stand out cuz [07:28] I was just trying to make people hear [07:29] about me, right? So like whatever it [07:31] needs, I want to stand out. They want to [07:32] look different so that if you see it [07:34] somewhere, you remember it and you can [07:36] come back to it cuz it stands out so [07:38] much. And being in the security domain [07:41] for being technical, but specifically [07:43] being in the security domain and being a [07:46] security practitioner, I knew how [07:48] everything else sounded and looked like. [07:50] Security products typically were like [07:53] black and red type of thing that really [07:56] most of the marketing was done on like [07:59] scaring people. Hey, I will help you [08:02] prevent this bad thing from happening. [08:05] And as an actual technical practitioner, [08:13] stressing me out. My job is hard enough. [08:15] And also because I understand the [08:17] reality of how complex it is to protect [08:21] an organization that also never [08:23] resonated well for me. So what I was [08:25] able to do is kind of like take those [08:27] two things and be, okay, I want to sound [08:28] different. I want to look different and [08:32] funny for my audience. I know the jokes. [08:35] I know the inside jokes. I know like [08:37] where they read. I know what they like [08:38] to read. So how do I kind of combine [08:41] those things to make it fun and stand [08:43] out and specifically talk to them? Like [08:46] for example, right? Like you know in [08:51] like we released the meditation app for [08:54] cyber practitioners. It has like guided [08:56] meditation sessions because cyber [08:58] security is stressful with like really [09:03] thing that can get shared within my [09:08] deep and good. So those are the types of [09:10] things I did to stand out fast but also [09:12] catch exactly my right audience. And the [09:15] second thing was like I knew I was [09:19] really focused on grabbing attention cuz [09:21] that was my problem. So I always thought [09:24] like what is interesting for my audience [09:30] caught up in your own doing even as you [09:33] know like even I like Instagram right [09:37] new Instagram feature so why would [09:39] somebody who does not use my product [09:41] read a blog about my features right so [09:45] interesting for my audience because I am [09:47] my audience and do I like release things [09:50] fast that speak to [09:54] just on finding early traction and [09:56] marketing and a little bit about maybe [10:00] is how did you find the right buyers [10:06] question. I I do think that obviously a [10:08] lot is changing and a lot is also [10:09] changing fast and a lot is still [10:15] important to always be attached to today [10:19] days ahead. I still think that a lot of [10:22] the core principles we incorporated is [10:26] at least for our audience which is a [10:31] selling like a very technical product [10:33] for security people for engineers [10:36] you have to go very deep so shallow [10:39] content was never enough but really deep [10:42] content still requires a lot of work and [10:48] automated around but you really need [10:50] that core expertise. For example, one of [10:52] the things we that works really well for [10:53] us right now is um [11:01] in the cyber security world, but [11:02] releasing really complex challenges that [11:05] teach people how to do security [11:06] hands-on. [11:08] Like you can think of them almost like [11:10] websites that are like security riddles, [11:12] teaching you cyber security, but making [11:14] it fun and engaging and gamifying it. [11:20] things always work for me because I [11:23] think the reality is you are truly just [11:24] giving somebody really good value and [11:30] do and that I feel still works for me [11:33] really well and it does it is able to it [11:36] is able to shine in the sea of SEO type [11:40] generated content which I agree is now [11:44] overflowing. [11:45] >> Yeah. Yeah. especially because AI has [11:47] made content creation both easier and [11:50] harder [11:51] as you were just related to as you were [11:53] building out the marketing function at [11:56] Whiz because how did you build out that [11:58] team right like who were the first 10 [12:01] hires that you made? What did you have [12:02] them do to build out this function? [12:05] >> Yeah, [12:06] so I built what I still to this day call [12:10] like the growth marketing team. Those [12:12] were like my first personal hires. So, I [12:14] hired that team of like brilliant [12:16] people, some of the best marketers out [12:18] there that are just like doers. They do [12:19] a ton of crazy things, like people who [12:22] made things go viral in whatever domain. [12:25] I was not looking for cyber experts. I [12:27] know cyber. I needed people that know [12:29] how to make things like go viral and [12:32] deliver them end to end. So, that was [12:34] like my first hire. It was like those [12:36] kind of like doors on the growth [12:44] design completely inhouse. So there was [12:47] like a lot of contractors. I just I [12:51] a core part of of a company and an [12:53] identity. So I brought the design team [12:54] inhouse. [12:56] Today in whiz the marketing team is [12:58] actually structured untraditionally. So [13:00] like about a year ago, I actually split [13:02] the marketing org so that the field [13:05] marketing org is under the sales org [13:15] like domain specific reports to me. So [13:19] which again marketing is so diverse. I [13:22] have to say as somebody who has not come [13:23] from marketing it was always so [13:25] confusing to me that everything has to [13:27] live you know like nothing is that [13:29] similar to anything else within the [13:32] ways to structure marketing teams [13:41] just relatively recently with hyperrowth [13:46] lot is I am seeing more and more CRO and [13:50] revenue leaders build what I call [13:52] parallel marketing organizations. Like [13:57] getting me the wrong type of leads, [13:58] right? Or I need more enterprise and [14:00] marketing is giving me mid-market or I [14:03] seen any CRO say, ""Hey, I want to take [14:05] over brand collateral and building [14:08] I am seeing more and more CRO build a [14:11] parallel marketing or mostly around [14:15] SDRs. I mean building a parallel or have [14:18] you seen that? Have you thought about [14:19] whether those lines should blur or [14:24] >> Very interesting. I think blurry lines [14:25] are a good thing. I mean, I have to say [14:30] blurry lines. I think really being [14:33] involved in sales processes, which I am [14:35] still to this day involved in deals. I [14:39] meaningful. It keeps you in touch with [14:41] the sales or in a very meaningful way. I [14:45] way. If our CRO started building a [14:51] great learning opportunity for me. I [14:52] believe people should do whatever they [14:56] to understand like what are they doing [14:58] that the marketing team did not do but [15:02] ways of having structures in orgs and I [15:05] think orgs are very different. So not [15:06] necessarily seeing it as a problem. I [15:08] think it could be a good opportunity. At [15:09] the end of the day I work for the sales [15:13] right. I do. I work for the sales team. [15:19] close deals and get customers. I mean, [15:22] if I was a CRO and I was unhappy, I [15:30] as the best just grow faster, right? Is [15:32] a recognition. Look, the reality is some [15:35] CMOs are more passionate about certain [15:37] functions than others, right? Some maybe [15:40] background, you may love the [15:41] quantitative side. You may love [15:43] campaigns and demand genen and staring [15:44] at spreadsheets. There are CMOs who are [15:47] great at brand and whiz is so big today. [15:49] You could probably just do brand, right? [15:52] deals. Like you get into deals, right? [15:55] There are CMOs who love field is crazy. [15:59] really good at events and their [16:03] of pipe in the enterprise, so they just [16:04] hustle field, but they ignore smaller [16:20] event or fields or brand or demand [16:28] just a new theme because it I just think [16:31] most CMOs have like two or three things [16:33] they like to do and the rest they sort [16:35] of hand off to their team or are [16:37] mediocre. [16:40] I think it makes a lot of sense. I also [16:42] said like our software is not [16:47] is a very very very diverse role like it [16:54] like I would argue that as a B2B [16:57] enterprise product our sales people own [16:59] a lot of the brand like at the end they [17:02] interact and how they behave and you [17:04] know the culture that they put out [17:07] approachable brand, but then you know [17:10] you meet my salesperson and you have a [17:11] really bad experience, it does not [17:13] matter. So the whole thing to me is like [17:15] one task for the company. [17:17] >> I just I personally [17:19] >> to I mean I know being outside of the [17:21] marketing board, right? I know how [17:24] almost like scary it was to hear CMOS [17:27] talk cuz they would use all those things [17:29] like like the demand genen and the top [17:31] of funnel and like brand versus this [17:33] versus that. And I mean now I know all [17:35] of those terms but I still try not to [17:37] think about them too much. I mean at the [17:41] into those categories then the problem [17:44] CMOs have to solve for is I want to make [17:46] sure the right buyers care about me and [17:48] feel positively about me and that should [17:50] help the sales process. [17:59] category so bluntly in a sense like a [18:03] year ago I broke off the field marketing [18:05] or which reporting CMO and now reports [18:09] right there. You broke it off, right? It [18:11] reports right? [18:12] >> Exactly. Exactly. Because I really felt [18:14] that like first of all, I found [18:15] personally [18:17] I think being a very successful field [18:19] marketer has more to do with having very [18:21] tight alignment with your regional sales [18:24] director. [18:27] happy with them? And the way I like our [18:28] field marketers was to ask the the [18:31] regional sales director, have you worked [18:33] with somebody you liked before? Could [18:35] that will make it successful. So like in [18:37] some ways I did not have a lot to give [18:44] want this sales or to choose them and [18:46] like them and work with them. I will [18:48] still give the content. I will still [18:50] tell them how they eventually look like [18:54] that they work closely together. Things [18:56] are very regional. So in my mind that [18:58] belong with sales. It also works that [19:00] way when you hire like you hire X [19:02] saleserson in Y region you get the field [19:05] marketer. So like put it there. [19:07] >> Yeah. Well, that is interesting. It [19:08] makes sense if the if the CRO is up for [19:10] it, right? You have to make sure you [19:13] way a CRO wants to go into the minutia [19:15] of of ordering the popcorn card for uh [19:19] they just want to influence pipeline and [19:23] all they care about. [19:26] like I went anywhere. We were there to [19:28] build a good VP there and like to to [19:30] make that work. But yes, [19:32] >> just one nerdy question on it because we [19:34] really interesting story just from a [19:36] budget perspective when you move it over [19:38] from marketing to sales. [19:40] Does that become part of does sales get [19:43] more heads and more budget? Does it stay [19:45] in your budget? Like how did you guys [19:47] just figure out how to allocate? Because [19:52] revenue that you get to spend. [19:54] >> No, moved it over with the heads in the [19:55] budget of course. [19:56] >> Well, the budget too, right? So yeah, [19:58] not everyone wants to release not every [20:00] CMO wants to release any budgets. There [20:03] are FFTs out there in the world. There [20:04] are a few folks who run FFTs and the [20:06] last thing they wanted to do is release [20:08] any budget. [20:09] >> You know, I do think that one thing that [20:11] can be underplayed [20:13] in in the fact that [20:17] I exactly have [20:19] >> always had a bit of the privilege to not [20:22] live and die on metrics and have a lot [20:28] let go of budgets or numbers or be or [20:32] saying, you know what, this measurement [20:33] of pipeline, I know it looks good for my [20:37] focus my energy on what I actually think [20:40] closes deals [20:45] here for. It enables you to do things [20:49] as marketers to work because you have to [20:53] like gain that trust and you have to [20:56] show the numbers but in a lot of ways [20:59] they can also lead you in the right [21:02] core advantage I had by not starting as [21:06] a CMO but by starting from a place where [21:08] I had all the trust in the world by the [21:10] exact and founding team because I was [21:12] almost like part of that before I took [21:14] over the marketing role. [21:15] >> Got it. Let me um [21:19] take you a different way. Curious what [21:22] probably the number one question [21:23] everyone has, right? How do you think AI [21:25] is going to change the roles of specific [21:29] marketing functions over the next 6 12 [21:34] it faster. I mean, we already every time [21:44] >> Interesting. in marketing and what we [21:46] call marketing. How dynamic do you think [21:48] it is? What jobs do you think are at [21:50] risk? Right? How you thinking about how [21:52] it will change the human side of [21:55] marketing? [22:00] anywhere near a marketing expert, right? [22:02] So like truly I am still very marketing. [22:06] >> Still learning, right? I really think [22:09] that I mean if I look at my own theme, [22:11] right? which is the only thing I really [22:13] understand and know about. If I look at [22:14] my own team, every single person on my [22:17] team has dramatically transformed the [22:18] way they work and that was also [22:20] something that I would not compromise on [22:22] like when we do team meetings, right? [22:24] When we do like quarterly summaries [22:26] where people present what they work, [22:27] every person has to say like what am I [22:29] doing with AI and show cool things to [22:33] least over a year. So it upscaled the [22:36] capability of people to be effective 100 [22:46] people are just now 100 times more [22:47] amazing and 100 times more effective [22:50] but I but I still need the amazing [22:53] people. I never have or believed in like [22:56] big teams and hiring a lot of people for [22:59] I was always about like I think a [23:00] superstar can do so many things and now [23:04] a superstar can do really endless amount [23:11] >> So superstars for sure, right? But in my [23:13] lived experience, sometimes the folks [23:15] that were superstars in 2021 are not [23:18] always superstars in the age of AI. [23:22] Do you think you can reskill people? [23:24] Like a lot of folks are talking about [23:27] reskilling go to market people in the [23:29] age of AI. But honestly, just between us [23:37] just showing up with a with a recipe [23:39] that you got on chat GBT to your [23:43] AI native. We had a CMO summit at SAS [23:45] annual this year. I mean, come next [23:46] year, we had hundreds and this Amelia [23:48] led it. It was the quiet theme [24:00] stuff. [24:05] I I want to be humble here and say like [24:09] had to share my perspective, [24:12] I I slightly disagree there, right? Like [24:14] I think when I say superstar, I never [24:16] thought about it from being, you know, a [24:18] super hybrid domain expert, but rather [24:20] being a person that is extremely curious [24:24] and just gets the job done. And I think [24:26] that type of personality thrives right [24:29] now in the AI landscape. One of the [24:31] things this CML I did a lot because [24:33] again the product is so like the domain [24:35] is so technical and one of the things I [24:37] was that was so important for me is that [24:38] every security person that reads [24:40] something or hears something that comes [24:42] out of whiz is like oh yeah like they [24:45] from being on the other side that often [24:47] time I would read something and it would [24:49] not be the right tone of voice right [24:50] like that the person writing it was not [24:52] using the right jargon like the inside [24:54] jargon so I would spend so much of my [24:57] time like reviewing things making sure [25:00] technical. Now I built like a super easy [25:03] GP that we call like the whiz spell [25:05] checker that is used not by marketing [25:10] organization. What it does is it makes [25:14] brand and tone of voice. Like you write [25:15] the customer email, you put it there [25:17] technically accurate users of bone. So [25:20] >> it checks every customer communication. [25:25] a super fan. [25:25] >> It can help. Yes, it helps you like [25:27] write everything, right? And it also [25:29] makes sure for example like one of the [25:30] key things is is one of our brand core [25:33] principles is being humble. Like I will [25:38] an AE to write and be like I want them [25:43] learn more like we want to learn from [25:44] you right so this also helps me with [25:46] those types of things so you can build a [25:48] tool and give it to everybody and you [25:50] can do that with AI tools today like you [25:52] could have never done before but I still [25:54] believe that at the end of the day the [25:56] people who are most successful are [25:57] hungry and curious people cuz to your [26:01] the tools I used 6 months ago are not [26:03] the tools I use today and the tools that [26:09] much to discover that they just need [26:11] curious people who are not afraid to [26:13] like figure it out and that I think [26:15] those people thrive. [26:17] >> What percent of folks do you really [26:19] think are that curious [26:22] >> a a lot a ton and with [26:28] successful than me. I want to believe [26:30] like a lot of people are this curious [26:32] today but I feel like it might only be [26:34] like 10 or 15%. [26:38] you hire, you hire for that 10 15%. I [26:41] mean look [26:42] >> I hiring, I said it at the beginning, I [26:44] am obsessed with it cuz I do think I [26:46] know nothing around it. Like, I want to [26:50] whatever it takes to hire for that 15%. [26:52] And honestly, I want to say that in [26:56] one on hiring [26:59] people that are humble, have a growth [27:01] mindset, and are obsessed with growing. [27:04] And you know we have of course like the [27:05] privilege of being able to hire for that [27:07] but that has always been a key priority. [27:10] >> So let me ask you related to this [27:12] because I just think the world is [27:13] changing right expectations for [27:14] marketing and sales. I was on a sales [27:24] months. Okay. So I know this product [27:30] coming out. And I got on a on a call, a [27:33] Zoom with the head of sales and I just [27:36] instantly knew the product better than [27:38] he did. Everything. It was 80 minutes of [27:41] torture. And my point of the story is we [27:46] think before AI, you might tolerate [27:50] customers are too smart in the GBT era. [28:01] I agree. [28:02] >> So, how do we enable our GTM teams to I [28:05] think they have to be smarter than their [28:07] customers in 2026. [28:09] >> I think they always have to be smarter. [28:10] I think from day one, like I never aim [28:17] bar is getting higher, right? But I also [28:20] think that you should never aim that [28:22] low. So, like in my opinion, like that [28:24] saleserson who joined the call with you, [28:26] right? That was never okay. It was not [28:28] okay before AI. And I agree with you. [28:31] mediocracy now is not hard to automate. [28:36] jumping around in a million. Going back [28:37] in the early days, you said your number [28:38] one job was folks loved Whiz, but no one [28:40] had heard of heard of Whiz despite the [28:42] media growth [28:44] for things like brand marketing [28:46] awareness getting out there. How do you [28:49] measure it? How do you measure it as a [28:50] touch? How do you measure it in [28:52] attribution? How do you measure its [28:53] contribution to pipeline in sales? You [28:57] know, I I think all of us go through if [29:00] initially skeptical of a lot of this [29:03] billboards, the dumbest thing in the [29:05] world, right?"" And then you realize like [29:09] are, [29:11] And so, how how do you how did you [29:13] measure it? Measure its contribution, [29:16] that kind of stuff on the on the [29:18] quantify it. [29:19] >> Yeah. [29:21] I I think because I came over to [29:24] marketing from an engineer perspective, [29:26] people really expected me to be like so [29:28] obsessed with the numbers and not care [29:29] about brand when actually in reality I [29:32] kind of felt like the thing that will [29:33] actually help me close deals if the [29:36] brand side like people hearing about us [29:41] deals and I you could sense it changing [29:43] very easily over time. Like when I [29:46] started we would walk into a room and it [29:48] was cold, right? Like you would start [29:51] from zero. You would have to be like, [29:55] company."" And then over time you feel [29:58] that the worms get the room gets warmer. [30:03] warm and your AES feel it too. So [30:07] just numbers, but when it comes to [30:08] numbers, I track a couple of things. [30:10] First of all, my audience, [30:13] my buyer, the budget at the end comes [30:16] from CISOs, the the senior executive [30:18] that owns the security budget. [30:20] They are a lot on LinkedIn. Like I track [30:24] how well we do on LinkedIn, how fast we [30:26] grow. I need that exponential growth on [30:30] me for brand because I can see the [30:32] amount of buyers that are subscribing to [30:35] my content there. Then I have the other [30:38] type of people, the people who actually [30:40] use with like the I mean at the end [30:46] be a team of cloud security engineers [30:47] and a team of engineers actually testing [30:50] the product so for them I measure [30:52] different things like that specific [31:03] level like data and touch points but I [31:06] also measure some key indicators that [31:08] for me just always have to show [31:10] exponential growth. I looked at the [31:11] number and I wanted to grow [31:13] exponentially, meaning you have to grow [31:14] 20% quarter by quarter. [31:16] >> Yeah. [31:16] >> Once they like, you know, touch points [31:18] and attribution and pipeline. Oh my god, [31:23] just want it to grow exponentially. [31:24] Really, every time you have a new sales [31:26] leader, you measure it differently. [31:27] Whatever it is, I want it to grow 20% [31:30] quarter over quarter. I just want it not [31:35] because folks are obsessed with it that [31:36] the first thing you brought up was that [31:38] the CESOs are all on LinkedIn. [31:45] quality bar is? You have to add some [31:49] content by the same time, right? And um [31:54] about adding enough value or what does [31:57] it take to build that that those [32:00] eyeballs from CISOs on LinkedIn? What [32:02] have you learned? [32:04] Yeah, being different, being a domain in [32:07] your expert, like really bringing value [32:10] really and not selling anything. Again, [32:15] not yet bought my product. [32:17] >> So obviously talking too much about my [32:19] product is not interesting. Like how [32:21] interested are in hearing about the tool [32:22] you do not use, right? Like [32:25] >> not a lot, right? But like if I know [32:27] your domain and I bring you truly the [32:29] best and deepest content in your domain [32:31] by the way like you are doing very [32:35] why have I heard about it why do we [32:36] listen to the episodes right like I [32:40] right that is what makes me subscribe it [32:44] is sometimes as simple as that so how do [32:47] we deliver really deep content [32:50] >> yeah it was interesting what you just [32:52] said [32:54] and maybe you were oversimplifying which [32:56] talked about content that folks who [33:03] Why is that? If you add value to your [33:09] to like CISOs are friends. They have [33:11] their own communities. They get together [33:15] sell whiz for you as much as you are [33:21] opinion, but why would you want to bias [33:23] your content so much on prospects versus [33:26] existing customers? [33:32] >> Like I have a group of 100 CISOs and out [33:34] of them like 50 or with customers. [33:36] >> Yes. [33:39] which are like mark like really get good [33:42] value to people. And also I have to say [33:46] not really interested in when I build a [33:51] for me with super duper interesting [33:55] have so many things going on in my [33:57] universe right. So even for whis [34:02] interesting in broader content and deep [34:04] security content. So for example we have [34:06] the best security content in the world [34:08] when it comes to protecting cloud [34:10] environments. Like you want how to [34:12] secure cloud environments [34:13] >> truly we have the best content in the [34:18] by top security researchers in the world [34:23] coding websites and coding training so [34:25] to me that is like a better way of of [34:28] giving my expertise unless you want to [34:30] buy a cloud security product right now [34:32] then my content is not you know what I [34:34] mean like I would rather that when the [34:36] time is right you would be like oh I [34:37] want to buy it from those experts in [34:39] cloud security and and read all about [34:42] to like bring a lot of people in by [34:44] writing all day about my product. [34:49] fun to ask these questions. That makes [34:51] sense. I just sometimes though when you [34:53] want when you are a leader um seeing [34:56] something really detailed like how whiz [34:58] is implementing MCP, right? It it may be [35:02] leader. It shows or a new product [35:06] not even a customer today. that shows [35:11] learning more about these specific [35:13] pieces versus broad content of how [35:16] artificial intelligence is is creating [35:18] more threats [35:20] in security like some sometimes this [35:22] vague stuff that marketers put out to [35:25] again going a couple steps back to smart [35:27] buyers you roll your eyes I want to hear [35:31] okay MCP is really interesting MCP is [35:33] also a security risk like just generally [35:35] speaking how is whiz thinking about [35:37] maybe one the hottest topics in [35:38] enterprise software. It has MCP itself [35:41] and yet MCP is like this weird holes [35:43] like [35:47] one out from the whiz library but um [35:52] exactly that intersection right you also [35:54] started from like what is most [35:56] interesting right now right and then [36:01] perspective but that is the right thing [36:03] to be talking about hence you see you [36:07] of course like a balance I mean we also [36:09] pose a lot about the product and [36:14] balance of like how do I always grow my [36:17] at the end I mean we are still [36:21] >> yeah yeah um and how do you sorry we [36:25] interesting when you want to grow your [36:26] audience and CISOs obviously the [36:29] bullseye right how do you think about [36:31] other stakeholders in the organization [36:33] and marketing to them [36:35] >> no seats are one part of it but at the [36:37] end My my best friends are the users. [36:41] They are the ones that at the end of the [36:42] day have to love the product, have to [36:44] use it, have to talk about it in their [36:52] the buyers, we market for the users at [36:55] important element. [36:57] >> Yeah. And and is the do you try to like [37:11] just managing cloud accounts that you [37:17] probably different types of content that [37:25] filed to IPO, right? They have their end [37:28] users, they have designers, and they [37:30] have all different stakeholders, and [37:32] those constituents, right? Um, sometimes [37:36] with one set of uh LinkedIn content. [37:41] community that lives in one one space [37:43] like security engineers live in a [37:44] different place and and you have a [37:46] completely different set of things for [37:50] from one content stream or one approach. [37:59] audience like chat or interaction. So, [38:01] honest like come back anytime disaster [38:03] either virtually or in person. [38:06] Let me just ask you a last maybe to tie [38:10] everything together and just like wrap [38:12] it up and try and give folks a little [38:14] bit of advice to tie into some of the [38:16] audience comments that have come in. So [38:20] talked about being very involved in [38:22] sales, in field, being, you know, [38:25] obsessed with recruiting, trying to find [38:27] that 10 to 15% that you want to hire [38:31] AI that are doing interesting things [38:33] with AI on their own already, regardless [38:35] of what Wiz is doing. Since in the last [38:38] year, right, like Alphabet from Google [38:41] agreed to buy Whiz for 32 billion, which [38:44] is quite an accomplishment. So what [38:47] that. Um, but just to tie that into the [38:50] next phase in a very SAS style way, like [38:53] what do you what are you thinking about [38:55] in this next phase, right? Like [38:56] obviously things have changed a lot. [39:02] entire journey so far. What are you [39:10] give us, you know, your best either gut [39:12] feeling or intentions on where do you [39:15] see this going? You could talk about [39:18] involved in everything, right? Where do [39:20] you see this going now in the next [39:22] evolution of whis? [39:27] is truthfully um I think we feel like [39:31] everything is in the cloud and [39:32] everything is AI and in reality like 90% [39:35] of the workloads in the world are not on [39:42] in the journey AI is only pushing teams [39:44] like faster and faster to the cloud into [39:45] adopting new technology. [39:48] just getting started. [39:50] that that basically how you feel. I feel [39:59] any parting advice because I know we [40:00] talked a bit a little bit about it but [40:02] we have so many f there there are a lot [40:04] of marketers on today and a lot of sales [40:05] folks but any last advice for founders [40:08] that are trying to hire that great 10 to [40:10] 15%. [40:18] important thing. I just want to take [40:19] this off my plate. [40:24] and every single person you hire should [40:26] be your best hire ever. And unless you [40:28] live in Unless you leave an interview. [40:31] Very excited. Excited. Like, I wish this [40:34] person was here right now. Like, you [40:36] know, he lifted the energy in the room [40:38] or in the Zoom. [40:52] many talented people. Truly. [40:56] >> I love it. Well, thanks so much for [40:59] all have to try and strive to get to [41:06] Thanks so much for doing this. So, [41:07] thanks so much for doing this again.

"Scaling a PLG giant into the Enterprise. Discover Canva's framework for turning product usage data into sales signals while preserving a value-first, customer-obsessed culture.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

14:54 [Sales Ops/AE] Implement a data-driven outreach model. The process is: gather data on product usage (e.g., network effects, collaboration within an organization), use that data to generate signals of interest or expansion potential, and then use those signals to drive specific actions. These actions can be a sequence of touchless signals (email, in-product messages, ABM, retargeting) before triggering a human outbound motion from an AE or BDR.

16:06 [Sales Leadership/Enablement] Adopt a formal sales methodology to create a consistent process. The speaker mentions choosing ""Winning by Design"" and using the ""SPICED"" framework, with a company-specific ""Canva flare on it."" This provides a common language and process for the sales team.

19:52 [Leadership] Break down the organizational silo between the high-touch enterprise customer success team and the marketing/product teams managing touchless PLG customers. Treat all users as a single common population, recognizing that individuals, teams, and enterprise accounts are all part of the same customer base. This prevents a disjointed customer experience.

21:21 [Sales/CS Leadership] Implement a scaled, tiered customer engagement model. The first attempt to deliver value should always be digital (in-product, email, AI). If that is not sufficient, the next step is to pull customers into group sessions (webinars, group Zooms). Only after those scaled methods are exhausted should you offer a 1-on-1 connection with a customer success rep, ensuring the economics of support are managed.

25:28 [Sales Ops/Leadership] To implement AI, start by identifying the most complex workflows and processes within the sales and CS functions. Then, ""stitch AI next to those"" to simplify them. The advice is to start by implementing existing AI tools rather than trying to build proprietary ones from the start.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

11:07 [10:44] It is far easier to transition from a Product-Led Growth (PLG) model to a Sales-Led Growth (SLG) model than the other way around. A well-instrumented PLG motion provides the critical data needed to build an effective, signal-based sales-led approach.

23:28 [23:56] The same level of discipline and orchestration used for pre-sale customer acquisition funnels should be applied even more rigorously to the post-sale customer experience. The majority of value resides in the existing install base, not just new customer acquisition.

25:28 The primary role of AI in a sales organization is to find complex workflows and processes and simplify them for reps, making it easier for them to perform their tasks and deliver a better customer experience.

26:16 The core philosophy for implementing AI in sales should be: ""Data drives signals. Signals guide actions."" AI is the engine that helps identify the right signals from vast amounts of data to prompt the most effective actions from the team.

3.Key Quotes:

14:54 ""data drives signals and then signals drive actions.""

21:18 ""We worry a lot less about how much they're paying us. We worry a lot more about how much value are they getting out of the product.""

23:32 ""we should be better in the postale orchestration of customer experiences than we are in the front side because the odds that the new customer acquisition in any given quarter is going to dwarf the current install base. All the value is in the install base.""","AI and the Bottom Line, How Canva Turns Freemium into Conversions with Canva's CCO","[00:00] you came in to build a different part of [00:02] the business in a lot of ways like [00:09] have a PLG motion and then you start to [00:12] go into the enterprise. What did it look [00:14] like day one? Yeah. So, I think the [00:16] first things first is and most of you [00:20] knocking around in the SAS world for a [00:25] go from PLG to SLG than to go from SLG [00:28] to PLG. That is a very hard motion to [00:30] back channel. [00:32] And so green flags for us were we had a [00:36] lot of data. We had a lot of good [00:40] necessarily in the ways that looked like [00:42] you could get a a salesled motion going, [00:45] but we knew what we needed to do to get [00:46] there. I think the other big green flag [00:49] was we were building an enterprise [00:50] product. So you we had an intentionality [00:53] to building something that was really [00:55] right for enterprises as opposed to just [00:57] having this self-s served product and [00:58] thinking we could charge more and jam it [01:01] into an enterprise. That was not our [01:02] mindset at all. We wanted to give value [01:04] first and get value second. Red flags. [01:10] culture that thought touchless. We had a [01:12] culture that like really leaned heavily [01:14] on organic network driven adoption. And [01:18] so we had to think about like what is [01:19] organic networkled adoption inside of an [01:22] enterprise.

[02:47] Success Venture Partners. The [02:49] significance of that fund is that the [02:51] LPs are some of the best CCOs in the [02:55] world. 130 CCOs. [02:59] to and talking about and talking with, [03:05] you all to my friend uh Rob G. Leho. [03:10] There we go. Did we get that right? [03:11] Nailed it. There. There we go. All [03:13] right. So Rob is the chief customer [03:15] officer at Canva where he oversees not [03:21] sales and go to market functions. Rob [03:23] brings over 20 years of industry [03:26] experience leading and executing global [03:29] marketing and sales initiatives. Before [03:31] Canva, Rob was at HubSpot where he was [03:33] also the chief customer officer. Before [03:36] that, he was the chief marketing officer [03:38] at Docyign and prior to that he spent 10 [03:44] goto market teams for their digital [03:46] media business and was responsible for [03:53] one of the most accomplished and [03:55] sharpest leaders I know in go to market. [04:01] go. [04:09] me right up. [04:11] Game on. All right. So, Rob, I got to [04:15] title, chief customer officer, but when [04:20] you know, the customer side of things. [04:29] is there are groups of people who care [04:33] the most about a customer and you [04:36] organize those teams into a single [04:39] organization. Some places call it go to [04:41] market. Some people call it the customer [04:43] org and some people describe the leader [04:46] of that group as the chief customer [04:47] officer really for no other reason other [04:50] than to give a title that attaches to [04:51] the most important entity in any [04:56] radar which is the customer. And I think [04:59] just by title it forces you back to [05:04] big big to-do about a title that just [05:06] really is for focusing you on customers [05:11] Like ultimately all of us exist. We [05:16] customers and somewhere in the mix we [05:18] forgot about that capital C thing, the [05:20] customer right? [05:21] Yeah. Yeah. And I think we we always [05:23] used to sort of have these like very [05:26] commercial sounding titles to do the [05:28] same thing and it just disconnected the [05:37] many companies have changed their [05:39] titling to a chief customer officer or c [05:49] operations and things focused on the [05:51] customer. I love it. I love it. All [05:57] market position though at Adobe at [06:00] Docyign at HubSpot now Canva. I often [06:05] building a career, think of your career [06:09] capitalist, right? Um, and unlike me, I [06:11] get to make a whole bunch of mistakes. I [06:15] the picker. You pick four amazing [06:18] companies. So, just like talk me through [06:23] process come to be? You know, how did [06:25] you know uh that that this was the next [06:28] one? [06:28] Yeah. So, how did I know Canva was the [06:29] right place to go? [06:31] Yeah. So I do I do a lot of mentoring to [06:35] folks that are younger in their careers. [06:36] And one of the things I describe is as [06:41] actually managing a portfolio of [06:43] opportunities. You have a portfolio of [06:47] a bet. And the way you place a bet on a [06:49] career should be very similar to the way [06:52] investment. Do you believe in the [06:54] product is a number one. Do you believe [06:57] in the leadership team and the culture? [07:04] removed from what happens with the [07:06] outcomes, the third one is can you make [07:08] a can you make a difference? Like is [07:09] this a company where your unique set of [07:14] adding some kind of incremental value as [07:16] opposed to just taking up a job in a [07:21] tried to avoid jobs where like anybody [07:25] could just do it because it would be [07:27] hard to really create a difference. and [07:30] unique experiences or [07:35] can be helpful to the company. So, Canva [07:37] was really pretty straightforward. A [07:40] massive customer scale with a product [07:42] that people loved, a leadership team [07:45] that had an amazing culture, one that I [07:47] really aligned with, one that was [07:49] definitely customer first. Like, we talk [07:51] about giving value first and getting [07:53] value second. We talk about our two-step [07:56] mission, which is we want to do as much [07:58] good as we can in in the world as [07:59] possible, but the only way to do a lot [08:01] of good is to to get a lot of value. So, [08:04] we want to be big so we can do a lot of [08:06] good. And so, I just that aligned really [08:08] well with me. And when I got a I [08:10] actually got a text from one of the [08:12] founders who I had met years before and [08:15] it was like the afternoon before [08:17] Thanksgiving here in the US. Australia [08:23] we talk tomorrow?"" And I was like, [08:27] family would be okay with that. Let me [08:30] sorry, mate. Early morning is middle of [08:32] the night for us."" So late afternoon on [08:35] Thanksgiving, we chatted and uh and the [08:37] rest was history. At the time, Canva was [08:39] like maybe 170 million monthly active [08:45] active users now. So, the company has [08:47] come a long way in a very short period [08:49] of time. Yeah. of getting a wow from the [08:54] people using the product every month. [09:00] a great product. [09:03] And I think the cool thing is a lot of [09:05] companies think about vanity stats. You [09:07] know, you could throw a chart like this [09:09] up and you could think about it as a [09:10] vanity stat, but we at Canva try really [09:13] hard to make sure that when we say [09:21] opening something and and finishing, [09:28] copied. Something has happened with that [09:32] that qualifies as monthly active use. [09:34] So, these are not vanity stats as much [09:41] really thinking through almost like the [09:43] desired outcome. And sometimes like yeah [09:45] the first click we measured it there but [09:49] like that desired outcome when they sign [09:51] up for Canva. [09:55] though like oh my god there those are [09:58] insane numbers. [10:00] Everybody I think admires Canva for the [10:05] You know if there was a poster you know [10:07] best PLGled company Canva would be [10:09] probably front and center. But you came [10:11] in to build a different part of the [10:15] you got brought in to build the [10:17] enterprise part of the business. So tell [10:22] big hurdle when you have a PLG motion [10:25] and then you start to go into the [10:27] enterprise. What did it look like day [10:29] one? What were some of the the cool [10:33] And what were some of the red flags? [10:35] Yeah. So, I think the first things first [10:37] is, and most of you probably know this [10:44] a lot easier to go from PLG to SLG than [10:46] to go from SLG to PLG. That is a very [10:49] hard motion to back channel. [10:52] I I worked on that side of the business [10:54] back when I was at Adobe and I can tell [10:58] mindset of enterprise only down into a [11:04] go PLG up market. And the reason I say [11:07] that is in a PLG motion when you have a [11:10] well-instrumented product and a decent [11:12] amount of customer love and product [11:16] day. And so green flags for us were we [11:20] had a lot of data. We had a lot of good [11:24] necessarily in the ways that looked like [11:26] you could get a a salesled motion going, [11:29] but we knew what we needed to do to get [11:31] there. It was literally all about the [11:33] data and its use. So that was one of the [11:36] biggest green flags. I think the other [11:38] big green flag was we were building an [11:39] enterprise product. So you we had an [11:42] intentionality to building something [11:44] that was really right for enterprises as [11:46] opposed to just having this self-s [11:48] served product and thinking we could [11:49] charge more and jam it into an [11:51] enterprise. That was not our mindset at [11:52] all. We wanted to give value first and [11:58] done it before. Uh we had a culture that [12:01] thought touchless. We had a culture that [12:03] like really leaned heavily on organic [12:06] network-driven adoption. And so we had [12:08] to think about like what is organic [12:10] networkled adoption inside of an [12:12] enterprise. And although I think Canva [12:16] good job transitioning early phases to [12:18] SLG, there are a million and one great [12:21] examples in the world that do it really [12:24] really well and arguably in many vectors [12:27] better than Canva does. And we try to [12:30] spend a lot of time watching what others [12:31] do and and we try to search and reapply. [12:35] flattery. [12:39] really special culture. So I imagine [12:41] like you know introducing this new part [12:46] the founders took lightly. So like what [12:48] was the journey they went on you know [12:50] were they you know fully fleshed out [12:52] with where they thought PLG could take [12:54] them was it the next frontier of scale [12:57] like what was their process when they [13:02] got a job for you here. Well it was it [13:07] to empower the world to design. So if [13:10] design, you have to be where the world [13:16] companies, organizations, higher ed, [13:19] places where applications in particular [13:23] SAS applications are largely controlled [13:25] by some sort of administrative process. [13:27] So think CIO, CTO, admin. And so to get [13:32] into those kind of environments, we had [13:34] to we had to think differently. And so [13:36] it started first with the founders [13:40] people design and create and [13:41] communicate. And then the next step was [13:46] thing that was really I think as anybody [13:54] an enterprise culture over here with [13:56] like all the downsides of what we think [14:03] lot of like you know sort of like deal [14:05] making finger pistoling kind of vibe [14:09] our culture. [14:11] We were you know we were really [14:13] interested in like trying to take [14:15] complex things and make them easy and we [14:18] were interested in helping businesses [14:20] express themselves and communicate and [14:22] scale and we felt like we could do that [14:25] with with an enterprise motion if we did [14:27] it in the context of Canvas culture. [14:30] Right. [14:31] So, like what did it all look like? Like [14:33] was there actually was there any AEES [14:35] there when you got there or did you have [14:37] to like start that from the ground up? [14:40] lot. There was a couple [14:41] and they were frustrated because they [14:43] knew what they wanted to do and yet, you [14:49] really like putting the right uh signals [14:51] in place. And one of the expressions is [14:54] data drives signals and then signals [14:56] drive actions. And so the data was [15:01] and sending signals to AEES. [15:06] steps or actions that live behind them. [15:08] And so now as an example, we gather [15:10] together network effect inside of a [15:12] business. We look at like multiple use [15:14] and collaboration inside of a [15:15] organization. [15:17] And then we send a certain amount of [15:19] touchless signals, email, inproduct, [15:23] maybe AVM. We might do retargeting and [15:26] then eventually that sequence is ready [15:29] for some sort of outbound motion, but [15:39] think data drives these signals. These [15:42] signals make us prepared to create [15:44] actions. And then we have to have the [15:46] right actions. And the process of how [15:48] you do that matters as much as the [15:50] skill. And so we started talking about [15:52] well what would be the sales process we [15:54] would follow and one of the first things [15:55] that everybody thinks about is like will [15:57] this be a challenger sale or will we use [15:58] medpic or will we use winning by design [16:01] spice [16:02] and I think those questions matter and [16:04] the answers to those questions matter [16:06] and for the record we did pick winning [16:08] by design we are using spiced we have a [16:11] little bit of a canva flare on it and [16:13] that process and methodology matters a [16:15] lot but actually what matters underneath [16:18] that is the skill of our team our [16:20] customer success team being great [16:22] communicators and having a playbook [16:26] getting and the AEES and our BDRs [16:29] working in collaboration to have the [16:32] right level of skill to carry good [16:33] conversations and the one thing that we [16:35] all miss everybody knows this is are we [16:40] for our customers and we anchor [16:42] ourselves on that like daily and so yeah [16:46] have the skill to have a good customer [16:48] conversation that feels genuine [16:50] that actually is empathetic around the [16:56] really will have a hard time growing [16:57] your your sales momentum. Yeah. And I [17:00] think like that throughine to the [17:01] customer is like so key. I was telling [17:03] you backstage, the co-working space [17:06] where where I work out of sometimes, Guy [17:11] chief product evangelist, he also works [17:13] out of there. And I said, guy, like what [17:20] but listen to this podcast with Melanie [17:23] and you know, they go deep on just the [17:26] the culture of Canva and the thing that [17:28] like really struck me was just like this [17:31] incredible customer centricity that [17:37] student sitting in some remote place [17:40] anywhere in the world right through to [17:43] you know a chief designer at IO maybe [17:46] that customer is front and center and I [17:48] thought that was like really a special [17:50] customer thought. [17:52] I mean it really like ultimately the [17:54] headline is it always comes down to [17:56] customer value. [17:58] The way we think about customer value is [18:01] we follow a customer journey framework. [18:03] I think most of us, this is not any big [18:05] like ooh new thing. Most of us do this. [18:09] But I think the difference between those [18:11] that talk about it and those that do it [18:12] well are the ones who do it well [18:16] actually start to embed the tracing and [18:19] tracking of a customer journey from the [18:21] very first point of awareness [18:24] all the way through some expression of [18:26] loyalty. And you can follow the through [18:29] line of this single customer experience. [18:34] actually looking at it at the customer. [18:36] How what what stages and steps are the [18:38] customer following to get themselves to [18:41] some level of loyalty? And are we [18:42] helping them or are they doing it on [18:43] their own? And ultimately, if all we [18:47] think about that matters for Canva is [18:51] interested in the product and leading [18:53] them through to solving the problems [18:58] might be scaling design, it might be [19:00] telling a story, it might be doing [19:01] something as simple as managing a social [19:03] media account. If we can draw them [19:12] the customer journey effectively. And [19:13] then now the question is can we do that [19:15] at scale and can we do it without [19:16] throwing a whole bunch of bodies at it [19:18] and so can we instrument it with some [19:19] digital experiences and some great [19:22] trained rep experience. If we can do [19:27] as you built that upmarket enterprise [19:30] motion there was a lot of culture there [19:32] that you wanted to keep but no doubt [19:34] there was like things that you wanted to [19:36] change in process. So what were like [19:38] some of the tweaks that you made and [19:41] what were some of the things that you [19:42] kept? Yeah. Well, I mean the nice thing [19:44] is on the on the enterprise side, there [19:50] One thing I would say that we had to not [19:52] do was organizationally, many of you [19:55] might work in organizations where you [19:59] the hightouch customer success team. And [20:03] a marketing organization or a product [20:04] organization that is doing customer [20:07] touches to your online PLG customers. [20:11] And what that creates is a huge [20:13] separation between teams that are [20:16] essentially trying to solve the same [20:18] problem, which is how do I help an [20:19] individual customer accomplish the task [20:24] I paying attention to some of the same [20:26] signals? And so maybe one of the things [20:27] that we like knocked down was we just [20:33] they are in businesses and they are [20:35] individuals and they are in teams but [20:37] they live inside of this common [20:39] population and that population are our [20:47] paying us a lot of money or a little bit [20:49] of money or no money at all. We should [20:52] actually be thoughtful about are we [20:54] helping them solve their problems and [20:56] are we moving them through a journey [20:57] with the use of our product. And if we [21:04] move up a version and maybe move to a [21:07] somebody else in their team to use the [21:09] product and ultimately maybe they become [21:10] a a larger paying customer. [21:13] And so we worry a lot less about how [21:18] We worry a lot more about how much value [21:20] are they getting out of the product. Now [21:21] our first intent because we want to be [21:23] scaled is can we do that digitally? Can [21:26] we do it in product? Can we do it [21:27] through email? Can we do it with some [21:28] other outreach methodology? Can we do it [21:30] with AI? If we can, we do, right? If we [21:37] to pull them into groups of customers [21:38] that have like problems and we can use [21:41] something like a webinar or we can use a [21:43] group email or we can use a group Zoom [21:45] session. we can invite them to connect [21:47] with a customer success rep with enough [21:54] what your CFO is going to care about [21:55] like what is the perouch cost and we [22:03] say that because I actually had a very [22:04] similar conversation uh with John [22:09] problem and that you know you could have [22:11] the end user using Canva to help their [22:14] kid with their homework and that person [22:16] actually happens to be the chief [22:19] customer officer at big company XYZ and [22:22] is pulling you up market into that [22:24] organization and so the blanket [22:25] statement is just like treat all your [22:27] customers like gold and and really good [22:29] things happen 100% Yeah. [22:34] pause and actually like unpack the [22:38] economics of our business models such [22:40] that we do think about like what is the [22:43] real cost of letting a customer wallow [22:46] versus what is the real cost of [22:48] providing some level of support and [22:50] would be willing to invest in building [22:52] an infrastructure that provides the kind [22:54] of scaled support and success [22:56] experiences that customers really need. [23:02] you is um we all do an amazing job of [23:06] customer acquisition. This is an [23:08] industry SAS in particular, we kick ass [23:11] and orchestrated customer acquisition. [23:13] Our lead funnels are dialed. We [23:15] understand all of our funnels. We know [23:18] the difference between top of funnel and [23:23] level of orchestration does not need to [23:25] live in the pre-sale environment. that [23:28] orchestration actually is better served [23:30] in the postsale environment. Yeah. Like [23:32] we should be better in the postale [23:35] orchestration of customer experiences [23:37] than we are in the front side because [23:42] that the new customer acquisition in any [23:44] given quarter is going to dwarf the [23:46] current install base. All the value is [23:47] in the install base. So I just I [23:50] evangelize that with our team. I [23:52] evangelize it with people that I talk [23:56] discipline. the orchestrated post sale [23:59] better than you are a pre-sale. And I [24:01] love it because yeah, we always talk [24:04] order revenue if we give them a great [24:07] experience? And what we forget about is [24:13] great experience. And and I think that [24:15] is really hard to account for and we [24:17] kind of just bury that deep somewhere [24:20] can really come back to bite you. [24:22] Yep. All right. So, we talked about a [24:23] little bit about your process. This [24:25] whole conversation was meant to be about [24:29] talk to you about. [24:34] here. [24:34] But, okay. So, like tell me some of the [24:39] got an AIcentric platform. No doubt [24:45] We think about AI in like two forms. [24:50] available for customers to use that gets [24:54] a pretty significant portion of our [24:56] attention as you can imagine because [25:00] hands of our end users that allow them [25:02] to scale imagery ads creation. [25:07] You know, we I think we recently shared [25:12] of AI usage, which I think ranks amongst [25:15] the top AI use cases with some of the [25:19] tippy top performers in the AI space. [25:22] consumer side. So just like the way we [25:25] try to make complex things simple, we [25:28] are focusing for our own team to find [25:31] complex workflows and complex [25:37] trying to stitch AI next to those to [25:49] great tools in the world. we should [25:51] start with those tools and implement [25:54] them in our own workflows as opposed to [25:55] try to build them ourselves right now. [26:04] building rep to CS processes that are [26:07] heavily underpinned with AI. We are [26:13] talking about these signals. You get [26:15] data to give you signals. Signals guide [26:16] actions. That framework is literally our [26:20] AI philosophy. Great data underpins the [26:30] we have a long way to go, which is nice. [26:36] public company, if you say we have a [26:43] getting it right for our customers. [26:48] to be thinking about ways to scale to [26:51] make better experiences for our [26:52] customers and make it easier for all of [26:54] our reps to perform their tasks. You [26:59] that has made you such an amazing [27:05] small problem for a niche group, right? [27:07] I think it the you initial goal was [27:10] people in academic situations and do [27:12] that really well and go from there and [27:18] I admire it a lot. So dude, thank you so [27:21] much. [27:22] And thanks everybody for listening. [27:23] Hopefully you got something out of that. [27:25] Yeah. Thank you. All right. Have a great [27:28] day.

"Enterprise AI is building an ""agentic layer"" over major companies like Singapore Airlines and Salesforce. This strategy transforms traditional contact centers from cost centers into powerful engines for value creation and new revenue.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

[00:22] [Leadership] Build an ""agentic layer"" over the entire business. The implementation involves creating an AI-driven system that sits on top of the company's operations to manage and automate processes, as the CEO of Singapore Airlines is doing.
[01:29] [Leadership / Sales Ops] Reduce contact center headcount and reallocate the resources. The implementation is to use AI to handle customer interactions, aiming for a significant headcount reduction (the example given is 30%), and then move those employees to other parts of the company that need more capability. [01:41]
[03:28] [Leadership / AEs] Use AI agents to identify and create new revenue streams. The implementation involves tasking AI systems with analyzing customer data and business capabilities to propose and deliver new services and revenue lines to the existing customer base.
[04:19] [Leadership / Sales Ops] Run an internal hackathon on new AI platforms. The implementation is to send teams to major tech conferences (like Dreamforce) and have them immediately return to conduct a hackathon using new AI tools (like Agent Force) to rapidly generate and test new ideas.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

[00:22] The future of business involves creating an ""agentic layer"" of AI over the entire company, fundamentally changing how it operates.
[00:36] AI allows companies to deploy a huge amount of value in a relatively short period of time.
[01:29] AI will drive significant headcount reductions in customer-facing roles like contact centers, not just for cost savings but to allow for strategic reallocation of talent.
[02:00] The full transformation from AI will take time; we tend to overestimate what can be achieved in one year, even though we are at the beginning of a massive opportunity.
[03:30] AI's role extends beyond service and efficiency; it is a tool for actively creating new revenue lines and driving growth, with companies making ""incredible revenue projections"" based on its capabilities. [03:51]

3. Key Quotes:

[01:41] ""...reallocate those resources to other parts of the company where I desperately need more help and more capability.""
[03:28] ""...how can they really provide more service to their customers, how can they provide more revenue lines to their customers?""
[04:16] ""...our guys went to Dreamforce they came back and we did a hackathon here on agent force.""",AI Revolution: Singapore Airlines & Salesforce Contact Center,"[00:00] When I was in Asia, I was with Singapore [00:02] Airlines is a huge customer of ours and [00:04] has been for a long time. Yeah. And [00:09] and service and Slack and marketing, all [00:11] the things you expect. But the power of [00:14] Singapore Airlines is that the CEO, his [00:22] building an agentic layer over the [00:24] airline. And that was very motivating [00:30] from idea to this point where these [00:34] customers are able to deploy a huge [00:36] amount of value in a relatively short [00:38] period of time. Yeah. So many folks talk [00:40] about we can talk about a little bit if [00:44] changing coding and programming. You [00:45] talked about freezing hiring and [00:47] engineering. I want to get to that. But [00:54] the transformation of the contact [01:00] at Salesforce. Salesforce has helped. [01:02] Salesforce.com. We have 9,000 support [01:07] half a million of these interactions [01:09] with customers and agents. But that [01:12] idea, I think, is pretty big and pretty [01:14] incredible. Yeah, it is. Do you I know [01:22] in a bunch of folks in the contact [01:23] center gorgeous which has 20,000 Shopify [01:25] customers and talk desk in the [01:29] already reducing headcount there 30%. [01:37] I would like to try to do that myself [01:41] those resources to other parts of the [01:43] company where I desperately need more [01:44] help and more capability. And I [01:47] encourage customers to really look at [01:48] that. That said, customers, especially [01:52] large companies like ours, the ability [01:54] to do something like that in a material [02:00] going to do in a year and underestimate [02:04] And that is where we are with this as [02:06] well which is that yes we can say this [02:10] center but we might be saying that a [02:12] year from now or two years from now [02:16] more examples we have pioneers people [02:20] beginning of a lot of these [02:22] opportunities. Yeah. Have you So we [02:24] rolled out a little AI just on Sster [02:26] itself. We had 30,000 conversations in [02:28] one month, which is pretty crazy. And a [02:30] lot of one of the things that surprised [02:31] me, I thought I knew about AI until I [02:35] really interesting how people do things [02:40] someone had a half an hour board [02:42] discussion about how to work with their [02:43] board. They up they shared their board [02:45] deck. They reached out to me. They did [02:53] seen that are unexpected are also [02:58] like talking about some of these [02:59] customer stories. Yeah. The Singapore [03:01] Airlines story, the Salesforce story, [03:05] a half a million conversations as we [03:12] And then when I see like really solid [03:15] customers of ours, LAR, which is one of [03:17] the largest home builders in the United [03:22] of not just using our apps, they use all [03:24] of our apps and do all the customer [03:26] work, but how can they really provide [03:28] more service to their customers, how can [03:30] they provide more revenue lines to their [03:32] customers? And that idea that has become [03:39] right now. that idea is going down that [03:42] this is going to be something that these [03:45] customers are going to be served by [03:47] these agents and for LAR they have given [03:51] us incredible revenue projections based [03:54] on what they have found and I think that [03:59] going to see with a lot of customers. I [04:01] think a lot of customers going to all of [04:04] tell you the most exciting thing like [04:08] called me originally CEO Steuart is [04:11] incredible person father was the founder [04:13] of the company and he said our guys went [04:16] to Dreamforce they came back and we did [04:19] a hackathon here on agent force.",2025-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PklsqfV-W6w
"AI's ""Tough Love"" for SaaS. A mandate to innovate relentlessly and abandon outdated playbooks, as the rapid pace of AI will make many current sales and product roles obsolete.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

20:53 [Sales Ops/Leadership] To improve your company's AI accuracy, you must actively train it. When you discover the AI is providing incorrect information or ""hallucinating"" (e.g., making up event dates), you should go into the system and manually provide the correct information to train it.

28:33 [Leadership] Conduct a ""start over"" strategic exercise with your senior team. Ask the question: ""If we could start over in 2025, what would we build in our space?"" This forces a re-evaluation of your product and go-to-market strategy in the context of the current AI landscape.

29:13 [Leadership] After identifying what you would build if starting over, you must find a way to build it twice as fast as your normal development cycle to keep pace with AI-native competitors.

30:34 [Leadership] Re-evaluate your team and begin ""moving on from underproductive people"" who are not adapting to the AI era. The speaker estimates this will be 30-40% of most teams.

30:41 [Leadership/All Functions] Adopt an ""AI-first"" operational model. For any given task or process, the default approach should be to accomplish it with AI first, and only use people to supplement or manage the AI's work.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

03:34 AI will be better than 80% of your SDRs by next year, making low-performing human outreach obsolete.

04:51 Roles in sales, marketing, and customer success that perform undifferentiated, low-quality work will be eliminated because AI can perform those functions more effectively.

07:51 The era of static software paradigms lasting for years is over. The rate of product change is now constant and rapid, driven by AI advancements.

10:12 AI is creating market instability by enabling a flood of new, highly innovative competitors, which puts downward pressure on incumbents' renewals, upsells, and deal sizes.

11:50 Enterprise buyers now have dedicated budgets for AI, but they are also under a mandate to consolidate their number of vendors, creating a dual pressure on sales teams to be both innovative and essential.

16:55 A significant portion of the current workforce, estimated at 30-40% of teams, will not be able to adapt their skills for the AI era and will not make it.

22:16 The biggest obstacle to AI adoption within companies is the ""AI slow roll,"" a form of institutional resistance from humans who are struggling with a rate of change unprecedented in B2B.

25:54 In the age of AI, momentum is more important than traditional product moats, as AI can quickly rejuvenate old products or make simple products functionally rich, eroding the advantages of established players.

30:58 Companies must learn to do significantly more with the same or less headcount, as AI drives massive productivity gains and eliminates the justification for traditional hiring models.

3.Key Quotes:

13:37 ""Be faking relentless in AI. This is what you have to do or you will be left behind.""

16:55 ""The truth is, and this is what I hear from CEOs, 30 to 40% of your teams are not going to make it in the AIH.""

[00:08] read SAS or know it. I got to be honest [00:12] It was last September. We switched to [00:14] year. And even last September, a lot of [00:17] stuff in AI, we were skeptical. Folks [00:20] were theoretical. We were talking a lot [00:21] about [00:22] hallucinations. A lot has changed since [00:30] contact center but the change is just [00:31] coming so fast and I saw it in [00:35] through but man when we launched this [00:44] 130,000 chats in less than eight weeks [00:46] on our AI in fact and the team that [00:48] built it the software Deli is going to [00:50] be here tomorrow after my session if you [00:54] seen now 130,000 thousand chats go [01:02] reviewed and SDR scripts written and [01:11] either here today or coming soon. And I [01:19] try to do a deep dive with more [01:20] learnings. If you want to come at 9:00 [01:27] just announced yesterday. They raised at [01:30] million, growing 10% a month with a very [01:33] salesdriven motion, but infused by AI. [01:35] So the CRO and I will be together. I was [01:37] the seed investor talking about how AI [01:41] importantly, how to be changing sales [01:45] much change that I want to talk about. [01:52] together. [01:54] But the theme here is going to be tough [01:57] love in a positive way. But the reality [02:00] is we have to move faster. Like everyone [02:14] ship, to do all these things, but [02:22] way I summarized it on Twitter the other [02:24] day and we were here in 2024. A we AI [02:28] a lot of folks still quote a survey that [02:30] I did 6 months back on LinkedIn. Have [02:34] you gotten your AI SDR to work? And [02:38] version of it a year ago. People like AI [02:46] beat an okay sales rep. I literally got [02:49] emailed from a human SDR today, this [02:51] morning. Hey, will you be at Saster next [02:54] week? Do you want to [02:56] meet today? This is from a well, highly [03:00] funded B2B company. Do you really think [03:05] be out of a job next year. He will be [03:07] out of a job. That is [03:13] from an AISR. Hey, Jason, I see you work [03:16] at Sasser. Oh, wow. You founded Sasser. [03:17] Very interesting. I know you probably [03:21] have a team of five in a weird quirky [03:22] business, but our product can solve this [03:24] problem for you. The A is going to write [03:26] that email and said, ""Hey, Jason, you [03:27] want to meet it faster next week."" [03:29] Literally this morning, guys, there [03:32] these people will all be out of a job, [03:34] okay? Because your AI at least by next [03:36] year is going to be better than 80% of [03:40] about a little bit today and a lot more [03:42] tomorrow. That literally is an email [03:45] $und00 million. Okay. A hund00 million. [03:49] Last week I had an issue with a10 [03:53] billion dollar company that has raised a [03:55] billion dollars, been a customer for [03:57] eight years, gotten them tons of [03:59] referrals, pay made them lots of money, [04:03] and we had an issue and I got an email [04:05] from a human associate customer success [04:09] manager. I have one hour next week to [04:10] talk, dude. One hour next week to talk, [04:18] somewhat successful founder investor. [04:22] dude after being an 8-year customer, [04:25] associate customer success manager that [04:31] about me, dude. And he had one hour free [04:33] next [04:40] tolerated this for a while. And frankly, [04:42] in 2021, it worked because anyone we all [04:44] had to buy software. We we got confused, [04:51] people are all going to lose their jobs. [04:52] And these are at very successful [04:54] companies. You will not need them. You [04:57] in support today. If you use Gorgeous or [04:59] Intercom or even Zenesk or Decacon [05:08] not going to need them in sales or [05:09] marketing or customer success by the end [05:13] not going to need them. Look, those [05:17] on that. Just quickly for folks here [05:20] tonight, there is casino today, but we [05:27] of parties. Go to the parties, too. [05:30] they kick us out for casino night. [05:32] Tomorrow will actually be the biggest [05:33] day. So, come back. If you have any [05:36] interest in meeting VCs or if you are a [05:39] VC, come to our founder VC brunch. We [05:44] It might be 11:32, whatever it is. But [05:48] everybody that wants to talk to VCs and [05:51] trick all the VCs that are here to come. [05:55] pitch finals if you want to watch it [05:58] more stuff than we do. Day three is our [06:04] AI with the CEO of Snowflake, CEO of [06:10] here with the head of AI from IBM. That [06:12] will be really entertaining. I guarantee [06:16] Calendarly. We all use Calendarly, [06:21] informal with hope. He will answer all [06:27] have a blowout party to meet everybody. [06:30] out. So, tomorrow the big day. do all [06:34] sign up for some brain dates if you [06:38] So, briefly, the theme warning, I I I am [06:45] Tough love is going to come. And I have [06:46] this every almost every founder I talk [06:49] to, any board meeting I talk to, most of [06:56] the meta issue for folks. And I know, [06:57] listen, the next 20 minutes, for some of [06:59] you, maybe, oh yeah, I get this. But [07:13] until recently, but I wrote a tweet a [07:15] little while ago that from like 2011 to [07:25] out something, they would have something [07:26] clever. It would have it would be a cool [07:27] new CRM or cool new marketing tool and [07:37] permissioning and some other and like it [07:39] like it would change like every five [07:41] years. Now the paradigms would change. [07:42] Someone would figure out something [07:43] really cool with mobile with something [07:46] and then it would be like static for 5 [07:51] even our little AI when we launched it, [07:55] like 200 VC decks and board [07:59] changes. Our own AI in the next release [08:02] is going to be able to join Zooms and [08:04] have full duplex conversations with [08:08] have to do anything. We just get the [08:09] benefits from our platform. The rate of [08:10] change is so fast. And I wrote this that [08:13] software actually never really changed [08:14] from like 2011 to 2023. And six public [08:18] company CEOs emailed me after that and [08:22] much faster."" Because honestly my [08:24] product uh in 2023 was the same not [08:30] a lot about it in the next session with [08:32] Ramen Yangan from HubSpot. HubSpot has [08:34] changed so much in a year. HubSpot has [08:35] changed so much in a year. So my tough [08:37] message is we were in this world and and [08:39] it was even worse than this because so [08:41] many of us had 110 120 130% NR for B2B [08:44] products and that was just the game get [08:47] in fact the original we go back to the [08:49] first annual the first theme was 0 to 1 [08:53] million impossible 1 to 10 million [08:55] unlikely 10 to 100 million is inevitable [09:01] unstable now and part of that in insight [09:04] which is obvious now but was radical [09:06] ical in 2015 is like this 110 120% NR [09:09] was the gravy train. It was so hard to [09:11] get to a couple million in revenue and [09:13] so hard to get to 10. But if you got to [09:14] 10 million in ARR with 110% NR, your [09:17] ticket was punched in SAS. Okay, just [09:20] ship some more features, fill some [09:22] feature gaps, win a few deals, hire [09:24] great people, but you had five years [09:26] before the paradigm changes. But now [09:29] just this instability is like stressful [09:36] If you talk to VCs here that have been [09:38] around for a while and you have a quiet [09:40] conversation, ask them how many folks in [09:41] your portfolio are north of 100 million [09:43] and now are seeing growth in the 10 or [09:45] 20% range. All of them. All of them. It [09:58] products is the real theme. Every VC [10:04] companies get to 100 million and see [10:08] seeing it all the time. Not everywhere, [10:09] but all the time. Okay. The other thing [10:12] that is creating instability with AI is [10:19] churn and renewal. Even if like your [10:23] a hundred new competitors here that are [10:25] doing super cool things puts pressures [10:27] on renewal. It puts pressure on upsell. [10:31] last year and someone here now can [10:33] automate the whole process through AI, [10:35] automate onboarding, automate [10:36] conversations, automate everything. [10:46] to downgrade. So, what a lot of folks [10:47] are seeing the little cuts. Deals are [10:49] getting smaller. NR is coming down. Win [10:53] coming down. Instead of winning 90% of [10:58] this as a red flag. see this as a flag. [11:01] this trend is going to continue. So many [11:03] leaders, so many folks at 10, 50, 100, [11:06] 500, a billion are seeing these little [11:07] cuts as the folks that are much more [11:10] innovative in AI are cutting away. They [11:15] that Twitter and is throw all these [11:18] stories. Oh, this great AI first SAS [11:20] company got to 100 million in 8 days and [11:25] destroying Salesforce. Salesforce is at [11:26] 4 billion growing 9%. Those stories are [11:28] like apocryphal. But much more common is [11:32] getting maimed by so much more radically [11:38] And the last two points on this summary [11:44] it. If you are there, every buyer, every [11:49] especially in the enterprise, every CIO [11:50] has AI budget today. We can talk about [11:55] budget for AI. So more money is going [12:02] mandate to consolidate the number of [12:08] lot of leaders that are benefiting from [12:10] consolidation. If you look at what [12:12] happened with Gong struggled for a [12:15] million. Okay? Why is Gong [12:19] one, they got a rich enough product that [12:22] Gong was hit when it was a smaller [12:24] product from consolidation because [12:25] people are like everyone loves Gong but [12:30] benefiting from it. But this [12:33] something you just have to deal with. It [12:35] is you have to fight. You have to be [12:36] more innovative. And for a lot of folks [12:39] if you probably have to tap into some of [12:43] growth that you wanted before. [12:48] aging out. And we really used to have a [12:54] of change is so high. So I just had a [12:56] little fun with my team. I gotta be [12:59] honest, I never read Amp it up. But I [13:02] got the vibe. Okay, the Frank Sloopman [13:04] vibe was everyone, you got to be a [13:07] monster. You got to destroy folks and go [13:08] to market. You got to work extra hard. [13:10] That was the 2021 vibe, right? Who read [13:14] Okay, you read it, right? And but [13:19] here tomorrow. Amp it up was great. Be [13:22] relentless in [13:23] sales. I I asked our AI app in 9 seconds [13:26] to make me a version of this. Be [13:28] relentless in AI. This is if nothing [13:30] else, this is my push, my nooch. Be [13:37] engineer looking at it. Be faking [13:40] relentless in AI. This is what you have [13:43] behind. You have to be relentless [13:45] because your competition is going to be [13:47] relentless. This is my theme. And just [13:55] some truth to that. But look at [13:56] Palunteer. Palunteer is reacelerated at [13:59] an incredible rate at three and a half [14:01] billion in revenue. All driven by [14:03] enterprise AI deals. The Department of [14:05] Defense is cool with AI. Okay. Military [14:08] is cool with AI. Conservative [14:10] enterprises. Palunteer is reacelerating. [14:14] at a 100x AR. Palunteer. So if you think [14:19] big conservative companies are ready for [14:22] just had the CTO of Rubric talk about he [14:24] sees it in security. There is [14:25] conservatism. I just did a hu deep dive [14:28] on our pod with Mark Beni off. He said [14:36] freaking Palunteer. Do a little [14:37] research. Palunteer is growing the [14:39] fastest it has in years. It is [14:41] reacelerating at a crazy rate. 39% [14:44] growth at 3.5 billion. How much is 39 [14:47] times 3.5 billion? Miguel, help me with [14:55] 1.6 billion of new bookings a year. [14:59] be thinking that like your customer base [15:07] stressful when you have new competitors. [15:13] people buyers are excited, customers are [15:15] excited, the market is excited. So I [15:18] get, this is really tough love though, [15:20] this slide is that because nothing [15:22] changed. This was a tweet I did that I [15:25] company CEOs reached out to me on this. [15:27] Because nothing changed. And listen, I [15:33] got soft. We ran the same freaking [15:36] playbooks, the same GTM playbooks, the [15:38] same cadences, the same, and frankly, in [15:41] some ways, Saster benefited. I benefited [15:44] believe the playbooks I use at Echosign [15:46] in 2011 still worked in 2021."" I was [15:48] shocked. I thought they would be out of [15:49] date in a year, but they worked year [15:51] after year. Now, you had to evolve a [15:53] little bit, but man, it was the same [15:55] playbooks. And then, and this I know [15:57] people get mad when I say this, the [15:58] truth is work from home and quality of [16:00] life meant we worked even less with [16:02] these playbooks. Okay. And it was just [16:05] too easy. And everyone thought they were [16:06] a genius in 2021. The average public SAS [16:09] company in 2021 grew 70%. Public public. [16:14] The average public company SAS company [16:15] now is growing in the teens. Okay. So, [16:18] we all thought we were go to market [16:20] geniuses. We all thought we were product [16:21] geniuses selling the same product in [16:23] 2021 we sold in 2019. Okay. We were not [16:26] geniuses. We were benefiting from a [16:28] buying wave. And so, got to change, [16:35] change. This is a tough question. This [16:37] is a tough question. And when I talk to [16:40] CEOs behind closed doors, when I talk to [16:47] had in public. And I ask them, how much [16:48] of your team is not going to make it in [16:50] the AIH? Okay. The truth is, and this is [16:55] to 40% of your teams are not going to [16:58] make it in the AIH. That sales rep that [17:01] told me if I wanted to come to Saster [17:09] Your CMO still running the [17:11] same human content SEO team from 2021 [17:17] going to make it. Not going to make it. [17:22] the sales team except for some maybe [17:24] enterprise stuff is not going to make [17:25] it. Certainly, we have a great CCO [17:28] summit coming on here today. hundreds of [17:29] the best CCOs, folks that think that [17:31] customer success experience from that [17:33] junior folk that said he had one hour [17:40] out, but I think the notion that [17:42] everyone wants to be reskilled. A lot of [17:47] of folks are comfortable working in [17:48] slippers from home three days a week. [17:59] chat GBT once a week to ask about [18:01] recipes is the same as being reskilled. [18:04] So this is not only does everyone have [18:12] see people are like shocked that [18:14] Microsoft did a 3% layoff this week. 3% [18:16] layoff. Okay. But those are folks that [18:23] more and more layoffs of companies that [18:25] are doing well. And the net headcount is [18:50] your segment, [18:51] literally 20 to 40% of support is all [19:00] that is doing support at scale may you [19:03] to decagon tomorrow the cos here which [19:05] is at the cutting edge but almost [19:07] everyone has humans in the loop. Okay [19:10] almost 40% of humans are often already [19:12] replaced with AI. Look at coding. I keep [19:16] front row but in Revenue Cat which has [19:17] 40% of all mobile subscriptions use [19:22] productivity about 50% using a AI tools, [19:24] using cursor and friends. 50 up 50%. 30 [19:29] literally at an investor meeting not too [19:38] gains this year and 30% next year and [19:41] like it just compounds at an epic rate. [19:48] The only thing he pays out of his own [19:57] team. Him. Okay. And again with our own [20:00] little AI play with it. We did [20:03] 139,156 conversations that did not tell [20:07] anyone Saster was next week. Not one of [20:10] them. Not one of them. Now it did. Now [20:16] This session will be in it. Everything, [20:19] every session will be in it. Every [20:20] tweet, every LinkedIn, are there some [20:24] fun one. Every question about this [20:27] event, it got right. Okay. But we do a [20:33] put the date up. So, people keep asking [20:37] London. It makes it up. Okay. Not five [20:48] an expert on how you vectorize this [20:53] after three months, I just go and I [20:55] train it in 5 seconds. I ask the [20:57] Christmas in London. Now it gets it [21:05] were right in a couple things I made up. [21:09] meta point here, maybe this is all the [21:13] say this enough time is this is what I [21:16] smell and fear. I see it in board [21:18] meetings. I see it in investor meetings. [21:20] I see it all the time. I call it the AI [21:22] slow roll. I just see it everywhere. [21:32] video sharding sharding on AI. Okay. And [21:43] they want to do it themselves. They [21:53] that they find are most resistant, but [21:59] being criticized. And just be aware of [22:08] not going to be as innovative as you [22:11] just see this slow roll for a variety of [22:13] reasons, but the reality is humans are [22:16] resistant to change and this is a rate [22:18] of change we have not seen in B2B ever. [22:22] slow roll and you got to lead from the [22:23] front. Aaron Levy will be here tomorrow. [22:26] Why is Aaron Levy and Darm Shaw and [22:28] others like really early on social media [22:30] constantly talking about the change? are [22:32] just trying to to the a million reasons, [22:35] but I think some of it is to root out [22:37] slow roll in their own organizations. If [22:43] this is just the thing that is [22:45] inadvertently toxic that is harming [22:47] companies deeply. This one we touched [22:55] more competitors and you have to be [23:00] the funniest thing is there are some [23:01] spaces that only have a few competitors [23:02] because of AI, but there are spaces that [23:06] and support that I no one wanted to [23:08] build in before AI. Now everyone wants [23:14] hot. Okay. Now in part because of chat [23:18] support right when I invested in talk [23:20] desk in 2014 or gorgeous in 2018 or [23:23] intercom or front no one wanted to like [23:25] ah this is low deal size commodity [23:27] boring. Now, like smartest people in the [23:29] world want to do these things. Sales [23:30] tools, sales productivity was pretty [23:32] boring until recently, right? Now [23:36] we had a dinner on Monday night and this [23:48] thing to automate sales research and [23:56] to build a B2B sales tool at 2 million [24:00] interesting things in that story, but [24:03] in categories that were less [24:12] going to radically change. If folks are [24:13] using MCP to go out to your data and [24:17] going to interact with your application, [24:20] river is the tough love. The last one, [24:22] this is one I think about a bit. This is [24:32] selling, but Moes versus momentum. I do [24:35] worry about this one. Again, when we go [24:36] back to the old days when software [24:47] structured data, right? the amount of [24:49] energy even if you wanted to leave [24:55] many moes between brand and those moes [25:05] but at one level as the AI get better [25:08] the underlying apps get less [25:10] differentiated the underlying apps and [25:14] talked about this company Gorgeous that [25:18] Zenesk for Shopify for e-commerce. [25:20] Really big in that ecosystem in the [25:22] Shopify. And before AI, the differences [25:25] between Zenesk and Gorgeous were vast. [25:29] large. But Zenesk has a really good AI [25:33] old, if the AI is really good, it can [25:36] make older products, different products [25:38] much better. It can rejuvenate old [25:40] products. It can make little tiny [25:42] products that used to be function poor. [25:44] Like your little tiny ankle biter [25:45] competitors that used to not do much, [25:47] they might be great with AI because the [25:54] tough, but momentum probably is more [25:57] important. We talked a little bit about [26:00] got to fight, but I this one was just [26:02] quickly interesting. Boldstart, which [26:04] has done a ton of great B2B investing. [26:06] Boldstart VC, they had their their CIO [26:08] kickoff at RSA, and I just like to [26:10] summarize this learning that they had. [26:12] Budgets still favor consolidation except [26:15] in innovation. This is just a macro [26:17] trend. I touched on it before, but this [26:19] is the reality. CIOS have money. Look at [26:22] Gartner. Overall IT spend still going up [26:25] like at record rates. 8 10% a year. [26:28] teens. I should know. But the overall [26:30] budgets are still going up at record [26:31] rates. There is inflation. And there is [26:33] other things but that money is basically [26:34] split into innovation AI and listen I [26:37] got to I want to shrink my number of [26:38] vendors. If you look at the XYO study [26:41] people are not adding a lot of new [26:43] vendors to their stack. So you got to [26:44] fight that. You have to earn your place [26:47] in the stack even more than you had to [26:49] before. We know this. But even as things [26:56] Consolidation is still a thing. [26:58] Consolidation is not going away. It is [27:00] enduring. People got burned out on all [27:03] the hundreds of apps they bought in 2021 [27:07] job to keep managing consolidation down. [27:10] You got to deal with that as founders. [27:11] You have to be more innovative and [27:12] provide so much value that folks will [27:15] break the rule and push to bring you in [27:18] this consolidation trend. You have to [27:20] earn it even more. Okay, we talked about [27:24] last annoying push. The only answer to [27:31] You got to work harder. I know a lot of [27:36] about working six and a half days a week [27:43] team is working 22 hours a week in your [27:45] nice hybrid office and they come [27:47] sometimes come in on Wednesdays and they [27:51] doing quarterly releases and your [27:52] competitor is an SF working six and a [27:54] half days a week AI first and pushing [28:00] probably going to you have to find a way [28:02] to get the team to work harder. You have [28:08] look at the interview I did with Mark [28:09] Bendy. Look at what Drew Hston said [28:10] yesterday. This is my last point and [28:13] your company for most of you. The last [28:16] thing that I want to break and bring [28:17] Yamin up, but this is such an important [28:20] exercise. Drew just talked about doing [28:21] this at Dropbox. Okay. My advice to you [28:24] everyone, Drew said he did this too. [28:26] Mark Beni off said he did it. If you [28:29] you go back, sit down with your [28:30] co-founder or your senior team and just [28:33] say, ""Guys, in 2025, if we could start [28:35] over, what would we build in our space?"" [28:39] conversation like that. Then be then all [28:42] the emotions will come out because [28:43] everyone wishes they were building [28:45] Windsurf or open air or whatever. They [28:48] easier, right? Revenue cap thinks [28:50] gorgeous is easier. Gorgeous thinks [28:55] easier. But say listen today if we could [28:59] you listen to what Drew said he said I [29:00] want to do this but I have 18 million [29:05] Dropbox because I got 18 million 2. But [29:08] Mark Ben off said. Most of you are below [29:10] the scale of Salesforce and Dropbox. So [29:12] go back, sit with your team and say, [29:13] ""What would we build today? How and how [29:16] can we do it twice as fast and just go [29:17] find a frigin way to build it?"" Whether [29:20] in a separate group, right? H having [29:28] answers, but instead of fighting the [29:30] 2023 battle, figure out what you would [29:32] build today, look at all the [29:33] competitors, all the industry, look [29:38] if you have a good team, a lot of them [29:42] excited about this meeting. A lot of the [29:45] found this figure in 2025."" Yeah, maybe [29:50] what the market wants today, not be a [29:54] maybe the mediocre folks in your team [29:56] will grumble and maybe they could find [30:07] talk a little bit more about this [30:11] back. Chime others are all coming. The [30:13] bar is 50% at 500 million. Sorry, I run [30:16] out of time on this piece. We can do [30:17] some more tomorrow. PE may not bail us [30:21] with the same amount of headcount. Maybe [30:22] this is the last point I do want to [30:24] break. We all have to work harder. We [30:25] have to be twice as productive. We have [30:34] moving on from underproductive people [30:36] through voluntary and involuntary [30:39] people. But this vibe from Duolingo, do [30:41] it first with AI and do it second with [30:45] WhatsApp and behind closed doors. [30:51] headcount anymore. So, not only do you [30:52] have to do twice as much, not only you [30:54] have two to 10 times more competitors, [30:58] to do it with the same headcount.

"AI-Accelerated Go-To-Market

Discover how AI is transforming sales by automating manual tasks like meeting prep, lead scoring, and pipeline reviews. This shift allows teams to operate with unprecedented speed, making product value, not just sales skill, the new competitive advantage.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

06:53 [AE/SDR] For meeting preparation, prompt an AI like Perplexity with your identity, your company, the person you're meeting with, their role, and ask for a suggested call structure and key information to know before the call. This can reduce prep time by up to 90% (07:19).

08:20 [AE] During a sales meeting, use an AI tool in real-time to ask questions about the prospect's company, such as ""what are the top three challenges company X is facing?"" (08:29). This allows you to show your work and research live on the call, building credibility (08:34).

10:58 [Sales Ops/Leadership] Use AI models to automate lead scoring as you build out your addressable market. This replaces a process that was historically complicated and manual (11:01).

11:26 [Sales Ops/SDR] After scoring your database, use AI models to overlay intent signals (e.g., hiring for specific roles, existing connections) on top of the scored accounts to identify timely opportunities (11:54).

12:08 [SDR] Leverage AI to prescribe the optimal outreach strategy for a given account by analyzing its score and intent signals. The AI can suggest the specific message and channels to use for engagement (12:16).

13:36 [AE/Leadership] Before sending a contract to legal, run it through an AI tool and prompt it to identify likely issues and key points to discuss with counsel. This makes the engagement with the legal team more efficient and focused on the most pertinent issues (13:45, 14:18).

14:47 [AE/Sales Ops] To accelerate proposal generation, upload 3-4 examples of successful proposals into an AI tool. Then, prompt the AI to generate a new proposal for a different company, preserving the style of the templates while personalizing it with real-time information about the new prospect (15:08).

21:12 [Sales Leadership/AE] Automate and objectify pipeline reviews by having an AI model read all buyer communications and join all calls. Before the review, prompt the AI with questions like ""What are the risks about this deal? What do you think the probability of this deal closing is?"" to get data-driven analysis instead of relying on subjective sales rep feedback (21:45).

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

00:00 Speed is the new competitive advantage in sales, and AI provides the ""superpowers"" to move faster than competitors (00:44).

00:37 AI allows sales professionals to conduct discovery before a meeting even happens. You should use AI to ask discovery questions in advance and arrive informed, not learn them in real-time (05:40).

16:25 Transactional and commodity-like sales will be increasingly automated by AI models that convert website visitors to revenue without any human sales touch, similar to how customer support has been disrupted (16:32).

18:47 Trust is the most essential quality for AI-first products and will be the scarcest and most valuable asset in the future AI-driven internet (19:09).

23:44 As AI handles more of the information gathering and analysis, the most critical skill for a sales professional will be the ability to ask the right questions and maintain a spark of curiosity (23:56).

26:26 The success of a business will become far more dependent on achieving product-market fit and delivering customer value, as AI will increasingly abstract away the challenge of building and scaling a go-to-market organization (26:35).

3.Key Quotes:

00:44 I think the imperative is to move faster because your competitors are moving faster.

19:09 And trust will be the scarce asset of the agentic internet and a lot of the products that are built on top of it.

26:26 so much more of the success of the business will be predicated on finding product market fit, like delivering customer value rather than being exceptional at developing and scaling go to market because I think that the models are going to start to become really good at that.",5 Ways AI Has Already Changed SaaS Sales Forever with Perplexity's CBO Dmitry Shevelenko,"[00:00] Speed is the new mode, right?

You should not actually be [00:37] be learning the discovery questions in [00:40] real time. But I think the imperative is [00:44] to move faster because your competitors [00:46] are moving faster.

[01:38] Every year bigger and better than the [01:40] last somehow. Thrilled to be here. My [01:43] name is Sam Blonde. I have a series [01:46] through Saster called CRO Confidential. [01:55] platform. Enough about me. We have one [01:57] of the coolest guests from one of the [02:01] hottest tech companies in the world [02:02] right now. Dimmitri Chevoleno is chief [02:09] talk much about you or the business [02:13] jump in, maybe just tell us a little bit [02:15] about your background and tell us what [02:18] talk a lot about how folks should be [02:21] leveraging AI in sales and more. [02:24] Awesome. Well, thanks everybody for [02:26] coming. Thanks Sam for doing this. [02:28] Dimmitri, CBO at at Perplexity. For [02:36] hard questions and we do our best to [02:39] answer them for you grounding it in the [02:42] high quality sources from the internet [02:44] from inside your organization from [02:46] highquality external sources [02:52] part of the perplexity journey. I [02:54] started my career at Facebook, was at [02:56] LinkedIn, was at Uber, had tastes of [02:59] hyperrowth [03:01] and got addicted to that feeling and [03:03] excited to be creating it once again [03:05] with perplexity. Awesome. Well, thank [03:11] Coming into the show, I often do some [03:13] research on the guests, listen to some [03:15] podcasts, those sorts of things. For [03:17] this one, I started with just asking [03:19] perplexity. It gave it a prompt around [03:22] this is who I am. This is a little bit [03:23] about the show. This is my guest today, [03:25] Dimmitri, and his role. What are the [03:27] most important topics that we could [03:29] include in the list of things to discuss [03:31] today? And Perplexity basically just [03:34] built the show for us. And so, you know, [03:37] they talk about like AI coming for your [03:39] job. This is one that I think is pretty [03:41] quickly being disrupted. With that in [03:44] mind, there are two really exceptional [03:49] the most sophisticated view on than [03:50] anyone in the world. The first is like [03:57] And so one of the things that I want to [03:58] do is talk about where we are today and [04:00] how companies specifically tech [04:03] companies should be leveraging AI within [04:06] their gotom market organizations. So [04:10] sort of intersection of productled [04:13] growth and salesass assisted customer [04:16] acquisition. I think perplexity has a [04:19] lot of revenue with a mix of sort of [04:22] productled or folks coming directly to [04:24] the website and signing up also sales [04:29] you know many if not most companies that [04:35] start with the for former of the topics [04:38] if you are a startup founder today [04:44] been a startup founder for [04:49] capabilities today, the products that [04:51] exist in the market and more. What are [04:53] the things that you are leveraging AI [04:55] for as part of demand genen and customer [04:58] acquisition? And then maybe what are [05:02] there? Yeah, I think we we were talking [05:05] about this backstage. Speed is the new [05:10] one takeaway, you have no excuse to not [05:14] be moving faster, right? And really you [05:16] now have these superpowers at your [05:19] fingertips. [05:20] And you know, I I think something I like [05:23] to tell folks is every question that you [05:26] would ask in a meeting with some, you [05:29] know, third party and an external party, [05:31] you can be asking those questions of [05:33] perplexity of different AIs in advance, [05:39] be informed. [05:40] You should not actually be doing the [05:45] the discovery questions like in real [05:49] like to use that that I think is the [05:51] best of both worlds. [05:54] But I think the imperative is to move [05:57] faster because your competitors are [05:59] moving faster. [06:01] I get asked, you know, [06:04] why is it that Perplexity is in the [06:09] is timing and part of it is execution [06:11] speed. If we had, you know, we got lucky [06:13] with timing. If we had founded the [06:15] company 6 months before we did, GPT3 [06:18] would not have been good enough, the [06:21] equivalent of it at that point in time. [06:24] create that initial magical experience [06:27] of combining AI with the internet. If we [06:30] had started 6 months later, there would [06:33] be somebody else on stage right now that [06:35] would have like seized that that moment. [06:39] I like to give advice for founders. [06:42] sort of the version of what I did with [06:50] rep. you have a meeting coming up, just [06:53] prompt AI or Perplexity [06:57] with who you are, what your company [07:01] their role is, and ask them like, how [07:04] should we structure this call? What are [07:05] the things that I should know going into [07:07] the call? And so, this is the sort of [07:08] like meeting prep that used to be very [07:11] manual that you can probably do in just [07:14] a matter of seconds. And again, sort of [07:16] like relating to prep preparing for this [07:19] show, I saved probably 90 minutes to two [07:22] hours on just sort of like prep for what [07:24] are the things that we should talk [07:26] about, tell me about Demetri just by [07:27] prompting perplexity versus doing the [07:29] listening to podcasts, a bunch of my own [07:33] thing to meeting preparation. Yeah. And [07:39] time you saved, you actually then ask [07:41] more questions, right? And going deeper. [07:45] challenges? Like how have they tried to [07:50] with the initial information, it should [07:52] spark that curiosity. One of the most [07:54] popular features in the product are the [07:56] related questions that we show below the [07:58] answer because the thing, you know, [08:03] learning. the, you know, a good answer [08:07] just begs more questions and you [08:10] actually want to [08:13] prep to the actual meeting, you want to [08:15] carry that spirit with you. So, what I [08:20] and I will in real time start asking [08:22] questions about the company that that [08:29] challenges company X is facing? [08:32] How have they tried to solve them? So [08:34] you kind of show your work in real time [08:43] you all to do this because if you can [08:46] prompt the right way and all of a sudden [08:49] your solution your product your approach [08:52] comes up in the AI generated answer or [08:54] it points to that man that is authentic [09:05] this new era transparency is everything [09:08] and if a smart AI is pointing to a [09:15] conviction in that direction too. Okay. [09:18] So I would I would categorize these [09:19] things as combination of like meeting [09:22] prep and meeting assistance [09:25] that historically would take 10 to 20 [09:27] times the amount of effort as as it does [09:31] today. Anything else that comes to mind [09:33] before we sort of progress? Yeah, I mean [09:36] I I think in general at the earliest [09:38] stages of startup development and this [09:46] coming up with new concepts, getting [09:48] feedback on them, that can all be [09:51] accelerated dramatically, right? And so [09:54] when you are then ready to you know put [09:57] put the pedal on the gas you should have [10:01] lot more concepts [10:03] and so you know using tools like cursor [10:08] to build many apps and perplexity soon [10:14] to be a coding replacement but to [10:16] quickly visualize different concepts and [10:19] get feedback on them that should no [10:24] an hour. And and you should be [10:26] constantly running through your head, [10:28] you know, how can I do in one hour what [10:31] used to take a day, in one day what used [10:34] to take a week, in one week what used to [10:41] little bit of my own color before we get [10:43] into more mature businesses and how a [10:45] company like Perplexity is leveraging [10:47] the advancement of this technology. you [10:50] know as a early stage founder myself [10:53] there there are a few things within go [10:54] to market that I am leveraging today. [10:58] The first is lead scoring. You know [11:01] historically this used to be something [11:02] that was pretty complicated that you [11:04] would need maybe revops assistance with [11:07] and it was like very manual and very [11:10] trial and error. Models are quite good [11:11] at this today. So as you are building [11:14] out your addressable market, the scoring [11:17] of that addressable market models are [11:19] very good at I I think the second thing [11:22] that I am taking advantage of and again [11:26] doing these things is intent signals. So [11:29] once you have a set your database it is [11:33] scored based off of you know different [11:35] tiers formographic information you want [11:37] to overlay intent signals on top of your [11:41] scored database. So these are things [11:43] like where do I have connections that [11:45] exist within buyers at these companies? [11:48] Are they hiring for different roles? [11:50] Whatever your individual intent signals [11:52] are that you want to overlay on top of [11:54] your addressable market models are very [11:56] good at that today. And there are [11:58] several products that do this today. And [12:00] then lastly on the demand gen side it it [12:08] type of outreach to take advantage of [12:10] given the account score and the intent [12:13] signals. So if we want to prescribe [12:16] reach out to this account with this [12:18] message through these channels because [12:20] of you know these reasons you know these [12:22] three different steps here score my [12:24] database for me overlay intent signals [12:27] on top of my scored database and then [12:29] tell me what I should do to break into [12:32] these accounts based off of the [12:34] information that exists in these scores [12:36] and intent signals. Models are very good [12:39] at that today. And so these are things [12:43] leveraging in go to market acquiring [12:48] behind. And then you described the [12:50] meeting prep I think very well. Once you [12:52] do have meetings on calendars I think [12:55] that the models are quite good at [12:58] talk about as as we get a little bit [13:00] larger and introduce more complexity in [13:02] the organization potentially you know [13:04] management structure and those sorts of [13:06] things. How is a company like Perplexity [13:08] taking it to the next level in terms of [13:10] leveraging either your own technology or [13:15] possible even 12 months ago? Yeah, I [13:18] think one mental model is to assume that [13:22] using a tool like perlexity and other [13:24] AIS, you can get to 80% of an expert [13:28] level in a lot of fields that you know [13:30] are not your profession, right? So a [13:32] good example is when I receive a [13:34] contract [13:36] instead of immediately kicking over to [13:38] the lawyer I run it through perplexity [13:41] and I prompt and I ask hey what are the [13:42] likely issues here and what should I [13:45] actually discuss with my counsel and [13:47] that way when I am actually engaged with [13:51] lawyer and then going off of what the AI [13:55] technology is. I know some founders do [13:59] about more mature organizations [14:05] efficient so that when a business [14:07] counterpart comes to them with an ask, [14:18] in on the most pertinent issues. And so [14:20] then take that same approach and think [14:22] about engaging with a colleague in [14:27] able to whatever your zone of [14:30] responsibility is and you need to [14:34] anticipate a lot of what they may help [14:36] you with. And so then when you do [14:41] sides a lot of time, right? And and [14:47] you have templates, right? So say you [14:49] need to generate a proposal and you have [14:52] you know three or four really good [14:53] examples. People love uploading those [14:56] into Perplexity spaces and then [14:58] prompting, hey, can you generate an [15:00] example, a proposal in the same style, [15:03] but for this other company? And where [15:08] to pull in all the real time information [15:13] them, and preserve the style of your [15:15] templates, but update it and personalize [15:18] it for that company, right? And you [15:21] should never then just take that output [15:31] saving you that time to get to the 80% [15:34] quality first draft and then making sure [15:38] intuition on that last mile. Awesome. [15:44] I think, you know, as companies mature a [15:46] little bit, you get more data and I [15:49] think you can train a model about [15:54] with different companies and and data on [15:58] sort of like how to position your [16:00] product. One of the things that Jason [16:02] brings up a lot is how effect Jason from [16:05] Zaster brings up a lot is how effective [16:08] their AI is at sort of like selling for [16:12] SAS. you know, they have on their [16:13] website, come talk to the like chatbot. [16:20] bit further on that specific example, [16:22] but I think generally speaking, [16:25] transactional sort of commodity like [16:28] sales will be disrupted in ways that [16:32] support has been disrupted where more [16:35] and more revenue will be generated from [16:38] just pure models converting website [16:42] visitors to revenue without the sales [16:45] touch. And I think that will continue to [16:47] become increasingly true. You know, as I [16:49] said, Jason was raving about how Saster [16:52] is leveraging their AI. And I wanted to [16:56] like play with it, see what all the hype [16:59] week, I went to Saster and it was just [17:03] late, but is there still any [17:04] sponsorships that I could take advantage [17:09] interestingly, what the model did is [17:10] something that I think a sales rep would [17:12] never do. And it it sort of like [17:15] downsold me. And what I mean by that was [17:18] it, you know, it sort of outlined here [17:20] are the types of sponsorships that you [17:22] can still move forward with that are [17:24] available. [17:25] Like I actually would, I being the [17:27] model, would recommend that you move [17:29] forward with like either a gold booth, a [17:32] silver sponsorship, or one of these [17:34] brand type sponsorships because one of [17:39] know if it was the platinum or or what [17:40] it was exactly, it was like, you know, [17:44] take advantage of all that that that [17:47] sponsorship level has to offer given [17:52] And like you know that just built a lot [17:54] of trust with the AI that I was speaking [18:03] rep would be recommending because of [18:05] course they they like want to maximize [18:07] the amount of revenue that the company [18:09] generates and and ultimately their [18:11] commission. So I I I think like that is [18:14] maybe some proof of models and AI [18:19] replacing salespeople especially at the [18:21] sort of like transactional or almost [18:23] commodity style sales. You know other [18:26] end of the spectrum you have the I I [18:30] are selling weapons to the government [18:32] probably need a human for that for the [18:34] foreseeable future and then everything [18:35] in between. Just building on that, I [18:38] think the the most essential quality for [18:42] AI products and AI first products as you [18:45] project out is what you were referring [18:47] to, which I call trust, right? And, you [18:51] know, you really have to trust a [18:52] salesperson [18:57] need. But the trust threshold for an AI [19:01] is even greater. And, you know, that [19:03] that informs everything we do at [19:04] Perplexity. How do we create and [19:06] preserve trust with our users? [19:09] And trust will be the scarce asset of [19:12] the agentic internet and a lot of the [19:15] products that are built on top of it. So [19:24] strategy and for folks that want to [19:26] build for the long term, you have to [19:28] build trust in at the foundation level [19:30] of your product and how you prompt these [19:33] different AIs. Yeah. I I I I think [19:36] A And then the second thing that comes [19:38] to mind as companies mature a little [19:40] bit. [19:45] demand or opportunities to revenue. So [19:48] closing revenue. And you know, you might [19:50] be a founder that manages some [19:52] salespeople. You might be a sales leader [19:55] that manages a team of salespeople. And [19:57] you know, this typically manifests in [19:59] what I would describe as pipeline [20:00] reviews where this can either be ad hoc [20:05] perplexity going and you get an update [20:07] from the sales rep. Over time it becomes [20:10] a little bit more formalized where you [20:12] know my experience and this was true [20:14] even up to something like 12 months ago [20:16] you have this incredibly sophisticated [20:20] revops influence process around you have [20:23] a 30 minute meeting with each of your [20:25] sales reps and in that meeting there is [20:28] within your CRM all of the deals that [20:32] have the sales rep notes that are like [20:34] ready in different categories for you to [20:36] talk about you know each of the sort of [20:38] risks and [20:40] you know highest probabilities with the [20:42] different deals and then through that [20:43] you kind of get to a forecast and you [20:46] know everything is like so perfect about [20:47] this process and revops has set up this [20:49] like beautiful spreadsheet and CRM the [20:55] you know you have like a a sales rep [20:57] that is adding their own like subjective [21:01] experience about the account like they [21:03] may want to influence the sales manager [21:05] to think that the deal is going to close [21:06] or they may be forgetting about what [21:08] actually having on the call. And you [21:09] know, back to your point around trust [21:12] today, you should have a model that is [21:16] reading all communication with the [21:19] buyer, the opportunity, the customer, [21:25] also should have an AI that is joining [21:27] all of your calls. And the AI should be [21:30] the one that is preparing for that [21:34] not actually the sort of like sales rep [21:36] subjective information about the [21:38] opportunity. This is like very matterof [21:40] fact. You have a prompt. Given all of [21:42] the data that you have in the model, [21:45] what are the risks about this deal? What [21:47] do you think the probability of this [21:48] deal closing is? What are the [21:49] suggestions that you have for the sales [21:51] rep? And so as if you are not doing this [21:54] today with a model this like pipeline [21:59] review sort of pipeline hygiene type [22:01] application you are a bit behind and [22:07] 12 months ago. Yeah the one thing that [22:11] you can rely on in terms of the [22:12] direction of AI progress is the context [22:18] to feed more into the prompt and get a [22:20] useful output. But right now, yeah, they [22:22] they claim million tokens, 10 million [22:24] tokens. When you start going up to that [22:27] size of input, the quality deteriorates [22:33] you have to assume it will get better. [22:37] in, not necessarily train a new model, [22:38] but just in the prompt pass in every [22:43] potential client and get that, you know, [22:46] honest readout and benchmark it against [22:48] the other prospects. [22:52] so fast with the progression of the [22:55] technology and then the way that people [22:58] are coming up with applying it and you [23:01] know we talked about a lot of these [23:02] things that even 12 months ago they were [23:04] either less good than they are today [23:06] certainly less um trustworthy or not [23:08] possible and in your seat being at truly [23:12] the cutting edge of you probably having [23:16] available publicly today. you know, if [23:22] project out beyond 12 months, what are [23:27] about that we can expect over, you know, [23:30] the course of the rest of this year? [23:31] Yeah, [23:38] a harder [23:40] challenge and and I think the you know [23:42] going back to where we started [23:44] coming up with the right questions to [23:46] ask will become the critical skill right [23:50] prompting [23:52] but preserving the spark of curiosity [23:56] and knowing [23:58] where to take the next question [24:03] smarter. the mo products of perplexity [24:06] will be better at incorporating many [24:11] solve the cold start challenge right and [24:19] that that you can project [24:21] will remain an evergreen problem I I [24:24] think where we want to take the [24:26] technology is to become a lot more [24:28] proactive rather than being reactive [24:30] right so instead of you having to always [24:36] with this account, [24:40] are meaningful and surface that to you, [24:42] right? And whether that be your personal [24:44] life, your professional life, [24:45] transcending there, [24:48] having these technologies become more [24:49] personalized, become more proactive. I [24:57] layer in a couple tap tactical [25:01] things that I think will change with the [25:03] way that that companies how companies [25:05] leverage technology. [25:07] You know, I talked about the different [25:10] peacemeal things that today models are [25:13] very good at scoring accounts, [25:15] overlaying intent signals, determining [25:18] what the best outreach strategy to to [25:21] ultimately generate a meeting and close [25:22] revenue is. You know, today these things [25:25] sort of manifest in like a very [25:28] peacemeal approach where you have maybe [25:31] one product or service or one approach [25:33] to doing the account scoring and then [25:35] you have to sort of like check the work [25:39] have like a different model, different [25:41] company, different product that is doing [25:43] the intent signals. Then you have a [25:44] different model or product, however you [25:48] outreach strategy. [25:50] I think there will be a sort of like [25:53] unified platform that comes together [25:56] that takes all of these sort of [25:58] disperate peacemeal processes and and [26:01] basically combines them. So can [26:04] effectively say like this is my TAM I [26:06] want meetings and the output can be the [26:10] these things are still happening behind [26:13] one sort of unified end to-end platform. [26:16] And I think because of that, what will [26:18] start to happen for technology [26:20] companies, for technology founders, so [26:23] much more of the success of the business [26:26] will be predicated on finding product [26:29] market fit, like delivering customer [26:31] value rather than being exceptional at [26:35] developing and scaling go to market [26:38] because I think that the models are [26:39] going to start to become really good at [26:41] that. And so for technical folks, I [26:46] really focus on [26:49] solving customer problems, building the [26:51] product, finding product market fit, and [26:53] gosh, like the risk around hiring the [26:55] right SDR leaders and teams is far more [26:59] abstracted away because the technology [27:01] can get so much better at this stuff. [27:05] example of how this may play out. We [27:08] have around over 5,000 enterprise [27:11] clients for Perplexity Enterprise Pro [27:13] and we have five sellers. [27:16] And so that I mean that also speaks to [27:17] like the PLG motion of of having a [27:20] consumerf facing version of perplexity [27:23] is very popular and that effectively [27:25] reaches every enterprise that could [27:28] potentially become an enterprise [27:34] for many businesses. How do you have use [27:37] AI to bridge that that kind of [27:42] enterprise version of what you want to [27:44] sell with the easy to get the 8020 of [27:47] the value consumer accessible version [27:53] you know an AI may help in crafting that [27:56] but that feels like a strategy to [28:01] smart sort of piggybacking off of your [28:03] comment around something like Yeah, I [28:06] it 5,000 customers from five sales reps? [28:09] Yeah, exactly. So, like, you know, [28:10] incredibly efficient [28:13] go to market model that you have in [28:17] leading you know that the product that I [28:21] are hopefully building [28:25] gone through sales cycles buying [28:26] products for the company that I lead and [28:31] there have been several instances where [28:33] it was sort of like a commodity [28:34] transactional sale and I was just like [28:38] the sales rep adds unnecessary negative [28:41] friction and like I have to wait on them [28:44] to respond and get back to my email and [28:47] gosh like I just want to buy the thing [28:48] and maybe I have some questions but [28:50] these are the types of questions that [28:52] the Jason Zaster model that I described [28:55] answers than the you know low paid sales [29:00] commodity and so I I think like one [29:02] thing that maybe slightly more mature [29:04] businesses and certainly businesses that [29:06] have been around for a long time should [29:08] start to think through is like is the [29:11] way that we are leveraging [29:14] sales reps sales people. I is this the [29:17] future or like are we actually adding [29:19] negative value by paying sales reps to [29:22] try and serve and convert these [29:24] customers and like you know maybe start [29:26] trying to disrupt yourselves a little [29:28] bit and what that will what that will do [29:30] is it will enable the salespeople to [29:34] focus on the opportunities where [29:35] somebody is truly needed like I I really [29:38] want to talk to a sales rep versus the [29:41] buyer like me on the other end saying [29:45] saleserson but are forcing me to and I [29:50] probably a little bit behind given the [29:52] capabilities of models today. Yeah. [29:55] Where sellers end up being still very [29:57] essential is things like security and [30:01] actually it goes back to trust where [30:04] somewhat arbitrary process. you know, [30:07] hopefully one day those become more [30:12] know, you need the human glue to to fill [30:18] upset me sharing this, but you know, in [30:20] your cell startup, one of the things [30:24] sonar APIs, which I think is, you know, [30:27] for folks here kind of at the earliest [30:28] stages of building [30:31] new products, being able to pull in real [30:35] time information, which is kind of our [30:37] bread and butter, but synthesize and [30:46] 75,000 developers using them and in very [30:49] much in the space where Sam is building. [30:55] really happy to hear that you your guys [30:57] are finding value there. We are happy c [30:59] customers. For the record, Perplexity [31:01] was not one of the companies that forced [31:03] us to talk to a sales rep that I was [31:05] really disappointed with. It was [31:07] incredibly easy to onboard. You know, [31:09] unfortunately I I think one of the [31:11] things we wanted to talk about was [31:13] productled growth. the intersection of [31:15] productled growth and salesass assisted [31:19] but uh you know your business is one [31:21] that does an incredible job with that. I [31:24] like music to kick us off the stage. [31:27] Dimmitri you are awesome. Huge round of [31:29] applause for Dimmitri. Thank you. Thanks [31:30] everyone for attending.",2025-06-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrn3pGOx_WU
Structuring a consumption-based GTM using a split sales force. How Snowflake's partner ecosystem and technical AEs accelerate enterprise growth and credit burn-down.,"1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

19:58 [Sales Leadership] Implement a split sales team structure where the team that acquires new accounts is completely separate from the team that grows existing accounts. The new logo team hands off the customer after a set period (e.g., a year and a half).
20:36 [AE/Account Manager] For the account growth team, the process is to become deeply embedded with the customer, understand their architecture and pain points, and proactively create business proposals for new projects that will drive value and increase consumption.
17:30 [Sales Leadership/Sales Ops] Structure sales compensation plans to be based on customer consumption/usage of the product, not just the initial contract value. This aligns the sales team's incentives with customer success and value realization.
18:27 [AE] With a consumption-based compensation model, the AE's ongoing role is to focus on ensuring the customer gets value from the product, which in turn drives usage and the AE's pay.
7:36 [AE] Use an internal AI agent to prepare for customer pitches. The tool should be able to analyze data on similar customers and suggest relevant, open use cases that the current customer has not yet deployed.
5:55 [Sales Ops/Leadership] To identify truly top-performing reps, integrate sales data (e.g., from Salesforce) with post-sales data (e.g., churn) into a central data platform. This allows for analysis beyond closed-deal volume to see which reps bring in the most durable, high-value customers.
21:35 [Sales Enablement/AE] Train sales reps to have a ""credible conversation with either a business executive or somebody that is technical."" The training should focus on distilling the technology's value and application to specific business problems, rather than just deep technical features.
23:08 [Sales Enablement/Leadership] Require sales reps to actively use the company's own product or tools built on the product. This hands-on experience gives them a better feel for the applications and allows them to speak more credibly to customers.
28:10 [Sales Leadership/Partnership Teams] When launching a new partnership, apply a milestone-based investment model. Start with a very small, dedicated resource (e.g., one person) and set a clear revenue target (e.g., ""$5 million"") before committing more significant sales and marketing resources.

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

7:02 AI is a ""big unlock"" for getting value from data, with the goal of enabling any business user to ask complex questions of their data, a task that previously required a data scientist.
10:33 AI is significantly raising customer expectations, causing them to push vendors for more intelligent, agent-like capabilities and faster insights from their data.
11:20 As AI capabilities grow, managing customer expectations becomes a critical part of the sales and customer relationship process. It is vital to distinguish between what is possible today versus what is a future vision.
21:11 To be successful in the AI era, salespeople must be more technical. Customer questions are more sophisticated, requiring reps to move beyond relationship-selling and engage in substantive technical and business application discussions.
33:32 The roles of technical staff like data engineers and analysts are shifting. They will do less manual coding and query-writing and more ""meta work"" to add semantic context to data, making it ""AI ready"" for business users to query directly.
34:31 As AI makes it easier to consume data, it will increase the pressure on vendors to prove business value. The CFO will see the rising consumption bill and demand justification that the value earned is greater than the cost.

3.Key Quotes:

19:58 ""the set of people that get new accounts are completely distinct from the set of people that are growing existing""
21:33 ""you have to be able to have a credible conversation with either a business executive... or somebody that is technical and be able to distill what really matters to them""
18:25 ""the consumption model is fabulous because we get paid on usage our reps are now focused on making sure that you get value from whatever it is that you bought""","Snowflake's CEO on the AI Data Cloud, Partner Strategy, and What’s Next","[00:00] The teams that close, the customers are [00:01] off the deal when it closes. They keep [00:03] it for a year, year and a half. We will [00:05] continue to evolve that. But the set of [00:07] people that get new accounts are [00:08] completely distinct from the set of [00:10] people that are growing existing [00:13] skill. The person that is managing an [00:20] 20 people. This is a big complicated [00:23] beast where you have to learn. Often [00:25] these folks, our folks know the [00:26] architecture of their customer. often [00:29] better than the customer because they [00:31] talk to everybody within the company. I [00:34] see. And the folks in the first group, [00:37] sales. Are they they need to have a more [00:39] technical background to be real and [00:41] expert in everything across the [00:42] enterprise? I tell I have a lot of these [00:45] conversations with sales folks. I tell [00:46] them you have to be able to have a [00:48] credible conversation with either a [00:50] business executive Yeah. or somebody [00:53] that is technical and be able to distill [00:57] matters to them. Yeah. And how [00:59] Snowflake, you need to know that much [01:05] example, with Snowflake, you can upload [01:07] a bunch of PDFs or images and do things [01:10] like image recognition. You know, you [01:12] want to do receipt totals. Not a [01:14] problem. You can just upload stuff. You [01:19] 7 billion parameters that Snowflake [01:23] But you need to know hey if you want to [01:25] extract [01:27] like numbers from a bunch of PDF [01:31] need to know the application of [01:33] technology to business. Those are our [01:35] best account exams. [01:42] Hey everybody, this episode is brought [01:44] to you by Adio, the AI native CRM. Just [01:47] connect your email and Adio instantly [01:49] builds a powerful CRM with every company [01:56] off your first year at atio.com/saster. [02:03] [Music] [02:11] We asked folks last year what they most [02:12] wanted to see this year and they said a [02:13] board meeting. They said they most [02:15] wanted to see a board meeting. That was [02:18] else. A lot of scaling revenue. So, um, [02:25] everyone knows Snowflake, although many [02:27] folks may not know as much about [02:32] been on the board, right? Since before [02:35] Sweetheart was acquired, right, since [02:39] pre-revenue, actually. Since [02:40] pre-revenue. Okay. So, you know, longer [02:42] than anyone should be on a board, but on [02:46] one of the most esteemed [02:48] GDM executives in I mean you were EVP at [02:52] Oracle, president at Semantic, ran half [02:55] of EMC. Did I mean pretty much [03:08] Snowflake, but his little startup was [03:10] acquired by Snowflake for a billion [03:12] dollars, right? which seemed like a lot [03:14] of money back then. Do I have that right [03:25] interesting. Founder CEO, but not [03:28] founder CEO is a very interesting [03:37] use this to talk about [03:42] the few snowflakes thinking a lot about [03:43] this right I mean few have been more [03:45] successful in the explosion of the cloud [03:48] few are thinking more about the [03:50] disruption right from AI today right and [03:53] for folks that know a little bit less [03:54] about observe interesting too and also [03:58] the other dynamic is if this is a [04:01] forgot the third dimension so Jeremy was [04:04] on the board Snowflake before it [04:06] started, right? Observe now is a key [04:08] Snowflake partner. Snowflake is a [04:10] significant investor in Observe and [04:13] Observe in part is an observability [04:15] platform on top of Snowflake. Right. [04:20] how good we are as a partner. You do. [04:22] Right. So, I want to talk I want at [04:25] least in our time that we have I want to [04:27] touch a little bit on observability. [04:28] Over the years since we started disaster [04:33] we had Lucerni in the beginning really [04:35] new relic in its day was was incredible [04:37] right we had Olivier came from Data Dog [04:39] when it hit 100 million that seems like [04:43] here twice with app dynamics and then it [04:44] seemed like things were quiet right and [04:52] that too yeah I can help with that [04:55] but maybe to set to set the stage [05:05] folks here have used Snowflake or their [05:06] team uses Snowflake in some capacity? [05:12] tell you a story and maybe we can use [05:14] this to learn about the future. One of [05:16] the Did anyone see Marshelle from Mango [05:17] Man? She was the VP of sales of the [05:22] a 20 millionaire. They do software for [05:25] salons and spas, but he is a data [05:27] engineer by background. And he had this [05:30] funny thing. He was wondering if his [05:32] best sales reps were really his best [05:33] sales reps. And he goes into Salesforce [05:36] like we do to the dashboard and he sorts [05:38] and and uh uh and Jason and Jeremy at [05:40] the top and Sriar is down sort of at the [05:42] bottom and he thinks he knows the answer [05:46] data, puts it in Snowflake, figures out [05:47] how to run a report, takes a few [05:51] out maybe an obvious but profound [05:54] learning from putting the data into [05:55] Snowflake, which is that his top reps [05:56] were some of his worst reps. Why? [06:01] had the highest churn. They had the [06:02] highest churn because they were pushing [06:04] deals through, they were so good at [06:06] sales, they were so his top reps were [06:08] not his top reps. So, one metatopic for [06:11] Snowflake is talking to your AI, right? [06:13] which you used to need a D maybe you [06:16] still need a data scientist and a data [06:18] engineer and the whole team but tell us [06:21] like [06:23] versions of that story and where will [06:29] first of all Snowflake is the AI data [06:32] cloud meaning we basically want to be a [06:35] cloud computing platform centered on [06:38] data whatever you want to do with it [06:42] analysis you bring some data in We want [06:43] to make it easier for people to bring [06:46] pile of new connectors. [06:48] But then analytics is what we were [06:50] always known for. Infinitely scalable [06:52] analytics, difficult ones, everything [06:54] from AML to predicting next best action [06:59] or as you pointed out detection. [07:02] But for us, AI is a big unlock as far as [07:05] getting value from data goes. If we can [07:08] make any business user be able to ask [07:13] big plus. You just showed me your [07:20] you should. But now imagine being able [07:22] to do that on every data set that your [07:27] thing. And the pieces to do that are [07:29] already there. And the next steps then [07:32] are going to be okay, how do you stitch [07:36] salesperson and you want to make a new [07:38] pitch for a use case to your customer, [07:40] you want to know perhaps like what are [07:43] open use cases that other customers like [07:45] this have deployed that this person [07:46] should. You also want to make sure you [07:50] How do you bring that into a single [07:53] Snowflake is headed, which is all of [07:55] your enterprise data, but now the [07:57] intelligence of something like Chad GPD [07:59] deep research with access to every [08:02] single data set that you have. We have a [08:05] bunch of internal examples of agents. [08:08] can do just by bringing it all together. [08:11] Just like I was totally blown away when [08:12] I first started using chat GPD deep [08:14] research because the ability to get a [08:17] high quality research report on a pretty [08:20] arcane topic was amazing. But I think [08:23] that is going to happen over and over [08:26] a company. And let me and I whatever the [08:31] how many million plus customers does [08:33] Snowflake have? I know you have to do it [08:35] Hundreds, right? Several hundred. Yeah. [08:38] 7 750 maybe more. Yeah. What are they [08:42] I asked the question when you talk to [08:44] them today. What are they asking for you [08:46] in the age of AI? What do they want you [08:48] to do more of in the future? What are [08:50] they what are they pushing you for on? I [08:52] mean, it falls into several buckets. The [08:54] most important one tends to be how do I [08:57] get more value from the data that I [08:59] already have in Snowflake. I was talking [09:01] to the CMO of one of the biggest mobile [09:06] of this information on Snowflake. I want [09:08] to build a better detection engine if [09:11] our is going to fall off in some area. [09:13] How do I automate this process and make [09:16] it much much easier to do while others [09:20] basically go I was talking to this other [09:22] company that came together by a [09:24] lomeration 60 different companies is now [09:29] has 60 instances of SAP. Yeah. If you [09:32] were to ask me how much money am I [09:34] making with this one particular customer [09:39] do to help me bring it all into a single [09:41] pane of glass those are the two extremes [09:43] of what do people want from snowflake [09:48] while when I was briefly a VP at Adobe I [09:50] had to install SAP locally on my windows [09:53] that was one of my worst software but I [09:57] a winner for snowflake right there right [10:04] And part of the value we bring to the [10:05] table is we can help these folks do it [10:07] incrementally. I tell people never sign [10:11] any of my engineering or like any team [10:13] comes to me and says I have a great [10:16] implement. I go like this is the age of [10:20] to me about what you can deliver next [10:21] month and next quarter. But are there [10:23] areas where you meet with them now that [10:27] in hard in the age of air? Are there [10:28] areas where the customers are pushing [10:33] raising all of our expectations right in [10:35] terms of what they want I mean agenti is [10:37] a thing because people can interact with [10:40] the chatbot people can run that report [10:42] on chat GPD and go like but wait I want [10:47] a push and we honestly try to temper [10:50] expectations in terms of making sure we [10:52] distinguish between what is doable today [10:55] versus what will be doable sometime from [10:58] now. You know, if you take a complex [10:59] process like a loan underwriting process [11:02] that takes like a set of analysts, if [11:05] building or trying to decide whether to [11:09] a dozen people working for a week. [11:13] like that. In cases like that, we can [11:15] probably simplify many pieces of it, but [11:17] not automate the whole thing. And so, [11:20] managing expectations is a big part of [11:22] what we have to do. But it all starts [11:24] with the data. Yeah. If you have the [11:28] have clean semantic information about [11:32] way to how do I get value from it and [11:35] there is this now hunger to do okay, [11:37] what else can I do with this? Yeah. And [11:40] so, and I want to come back to a bunch [11:42] of that, but but Jeremy, so when was [11:45] Observe founded before Snowflake or Snow [11:48] or before you joined the board? No, it [11:50] was Yeah, I joined late 2018. Late 2018. [11:54] Okay. And then because partnerships [12:00] like on the outside but the real story [12:02] is usually more interesting right [12:04] whereas and how much of the business [12:06] today is snowflake oriented I should [12:18] so you join so walk through how that how [12:20] you manage that this roundtrip [12:22] relationships yeah So when we were [12:24] founded back in 20 end of 2017 actually [12:29] we had a couple of early snowflake [12:31] engineers on the founding team. I Philip [12:34] Hunterbrunner who worked on the query [12:35] engine, Vidy Maninov who did the [12:37] unstructured data support and so we were [12:39] quite predisposed to building something [12:41] on Snowflake. It was actually [12:44] controversial in the founding team and [12:46] in fact we lost a number of members of [12:47] the founding team because of that [12:49] decision say came from snowflake or [12:54] there was a bunch of folks who had a [12:55] theory that every query had to return in [12:57] 100 milliseconds [12:59] which I would like that as well but [13:03] in an enterprise SAS application and so [13:06] they wanted to build their own database [13:08] um probably the folks who came from [13:11] build it on snowflake [13:13] And for me, I was on board fairly [13:15] quickly because at the end of the day, [13:17] customers are not paying us really for [13:21] analytics. They want to answer [13:22] questions. And so my thesis here was [13:26] engineering team adding value above the [13:28] database and we let the Snowflake team [13:30] build the database. Yeah. Then we should [13:34] be able to add more value and therefore [13:37] engineering team building a database [13:39] then we could be in trouble because [13:44] space I mean a couple of the folks that [13:46] you mentioned earlier have built their [13:47] own database [13:49] and our sort of strategic decision if [13:52] you like was when we are not going to [13:55] Snowflake and I think the most important [13:58] thing when you make that call is you [14:00] have to commit to it. Yeah. Because in [14:02] the short term, your gross margins are [14:05] going to be worse than comparative [14:14] to exploit the unique features of the [14:17] be the most efficient application on [14:19] that platform. And look, as we sit [14:21] today, I mean, our gross margins were, [14:23] you know, with tens of millions of [14:25] revenue and the gross margins are [14:27] already up around 60%. And so can we [14:30] reach normal SAS margins 70s and 80s at [14:37] through being committed and making sure [14:39] we are the best godamn application on [14:44] big commitment there. And then on the [14:49] lovehate relationships. You many days we [14:51] love Snowflake, sometimes we love to [14:52] hate Snowflake. But again, if you make [14:59] realize you are picking up a dependency. [15:01] Yeah, you have to build relationships. [15:03] Certainly technically, we were quite [15:05] fortunate in that regard. We could sort [15:07] of get bootleg bug fixes because we had [15:10] relationships engineer to engineer. It [15:15] And but then as the as the company [15:16] grows, what you realize, look, Sidar has [15:19] got this amazing like distribution [15:21] channel. And so you need relationships [15:23] not just in engineering but across the [15:25] board because we want to be able to [15:27] leverage the sales team and the access [15:31] enterprise player. Where not? Can we [15:36] relationships with the sales team and [15:38] they understand your value proposition [15:39] and and so and you guys are do you guys [15:41] actively crossell? Is that is that the [15:42] motion? Starting to starting. Yeah, [15:46] relevant and [15:48] really although our sales motion is a [15:50] little bit different, we go to sort of [15:51] DevOps and S people and I think the [15:54] Snowflake guys predominantly go to data [15:56] ops folks, Snowflake have excellent [15:59] relationships with the top people in the [16:03] warm credible introduction into an [16:09] precious. Does Snowflake [16:14] trying to close up sales or big deals or [16:16] is it downstream or where does it happen [16:17] in the in the timing? When do folks [16:20] realize they need the platform or want [16:21] the platform the observe platform? [16:24] Yeah. I mean and buy snowflake without I [16:26] mean you buy observe without really [16:28] buying snowflake and vice versa but we [16:31] also bunch go to a set of customers [16:35] mean our motion we we go sell off [16:36] observe and and think of Snowflake is [16:39] sort of the the man behind the curtain. [16:48] no no they they they pay for observe and [16:50] everything is included completely [16:52] embedded. But where it does play out in [16:54] the larger accounts obviously through [16:58] enterprise customer may have a big [17:00] commit with Snowflake. Well, they can [17:02] actually burn down that commit by buying [17:07] and and this relationship works great [17:08] with like Amazon and GCP on their [17:10] marketplaces as well. Yeah. So, you know [17:13] that there is a a big benefit, you know, [17:15] to your average Snowflake rep because we [17:17] can help burn down credits that have [17:19] been sold into that account. I get the [17:22] pre-commit, right? It helps. How does [17:27] now get paid on that. I do our our reps [17:30] are based on consumption for sure. [17:36] consumption. [17:37] Snowflake recognizes revenue only when [17:40] customers actually consume. Even if [17:42] there is a the pre-commit merely ensures [17:45] supply of credits at a certain rate, but [17:48] they actually have to consume it for us [17:52] study Snowflake and I get the model, but [17:56] So when we talk about skill Yeah. uh you [18:05] 500k a deal a year for 5 years if they [18:08] backloaded and use it all year three [18:15] get to ratibly recognize the contract it [18:19] are limits on you know how much you can [18:21] roll over and stuff like that but the [18:23] consumption model is fabulous because we [18:25] get paid on usage our reps are now [18:27] focused on making sure that you get [18:29] value from whatever it is that you [18:34] startups might get this accounting wrong [18:39] I think they might just think if I I at [18:41] least can somehow recognize most of it. [18:46] incentive right you want as much data as [18:48] much workloads as much going. So what [18:50] does that I mean it relates to observe [18:52] it is interesting. So what does that [18:54] mean for your average AE? What are they [18:57] doing with the customer 3, six, nine, 12 [19:00] insided to grow that account, right? [19:02] Yeah. And so they absolutely they sell [19:05] deals to the customer. Our typical first [19:07] deals are like 50k, 100k. They tend to [19:10] start small. Yeah. And then we go in [19:12] implement the project either snowflake [19:14] or the customer or a an SI system [19:17] integrator partner. Yeah. And that [19:19] drives a certain amount of consumption, [19:20] a certain amount of value, and then they [19:22] turn around and sign a bigger contract. [19:25] Some of our biggest customers have gone [19:27] from like 0 to 1 to two to five over [19:29] space of two two and a half years. But [19:31] all of it is driven by what are use [19:33] cases you can create and uh every week [19:36] snowflake lives and dies by how many new [19:38] use cases did you create, how many did [19:43] motion that we are living. Yeah. And how [19:47] do you get the reps to like do new [19:49] accounts when all the money is in [19:50] getting their existing ones to grow? [19:52] Great question. We have completely [19:58] closes it is off the deal. Sorry the the [20:00] teams that close the customers are off [20:02] the deal when it closes. They keep it [20:03] for a year year and a half. We will [20:05] continue to evolve that. But the set of [20:07] people that get new accounts are [20:09] completely distinct from the set of [20:10] people that are growing existing [20:14] skill. The person that is managing an [20:21] 20 people. This is a big complicated [20:23] beast where you have to learn. Often [20:25] these folks, our folks know the [20:27] architecture of their customer often [20:30] better than the customer because they [20:31] talk to everybody within the company. [20:34] They know what the pain points are. They [20:36] make business proposals for hey, we can [20:38] do this project over here. We can make [20:40] your regulatory reporting a whole lot [20:42] simpler or we can do this other thing. [20:44] And so they are on that cadence of how [20:47] do you create value with the customer. [20:50] focused on, you know, us winning five [20:53] 600 new logos every I see. And the folks [20:59] need to have a more technical background [21:01] to be real and expert in everything [21:03] across the enterprise. So we do have [21:04] solution engineers. So we have uh both [21:08] account executives as well as solution [21:10] engineers. But honestly, you have to be [21:11] pretty technical today to succeed [21:13] because your customer is going to ask [21:18] code your way through answering what [21:25] of being technical for sales. How [21:27] technical do you think you have to be 1 [21:28] to 10 to succeed at snowflake? I tell I [21:31] have a lot of these conversations with [21:33] sales folks. I tell them you have to be [21:35] able to have a credible conversation [21:37] with either a business executive Yeah. [21:39] or somebody that is technical and be [21:44] that really matters to them and how [21:46] Snowflake applies. You need to know that [21:52] underneath. So for example, with [21:53] Snowflake, you can upload a bunch of [21:55] PDFs or images and do things like image [21:58] recognition. You know, you want to do [22:00] receipt totals, not a problem. You can [22:02] just upload stuff, you do that. As a [22:07] parameters that Snowflake developed. [22:11] to know, hey, if you want to extract [22:14] like numbers from a bunch of PDF [22:16] contracts, Snowflake can do that. So, [22:19] application of technology to business. [22:22] Those are our best account exacts. Yeah. [22:24] I have a founder I work with and um they [22:27] closed a seven figure deal with OpenAI [22:29] and they had they had what they thought [22:31] was a relatively technical CRO but when [22:33] they went to close the seven figure deal [22:35] they just left them in the lobby. [22:40] like because the questions were just so [22:42] good that they really felt I have no [22:48] extreme case, but I think about this. I [22:51] guy in the room because the questions [22:53] from the open AI team are just too good. [22:58] any, you know, talking about golf or who [23:00] won the NBA finals is just not helpful [23:02] to getting the VP of engineering to buy. [23:06] I mean, I really encourage all our folks [23:08] to use the products or use tools that [23:10] are built on our products. If you use [23:15] Similarly, if you use Sigma as a [23:16] dashboard and it runs on top of [23:18] Snowflake, you have a good feel for [23:22] applications is something that they [23:24] should be able to do and then pattern [23:26] matching like business problems to here [23:28] are things we can solve and separating [23:30] out. Yeah, this customer wants this zero [23:33] chance we can do this in the next 10 [23:39] get it now. So we hit it and maybe we [23:40] hit it enough Jeremy, but so your team [23:42] is hyperfocused on enabling them to burn [23:46] down these commits, right? Yeah. The [23:49] nice huge unlock, right? The nice thing [23:51] it took us a while to get there, but the [23:53] snowflake rep is paid whether we burn [23:57] account or whether it runs on our [23:58] multi-tenant SAS environment. Yeah. So [24:01] the the nice thing there is the rep [24:04] deployed. We can deploy against the [24:05] customer snowflake tenant or we can [24:07] deploy it on a multi-tenant. But yeah, [24:09] the big incentive for the for the rep is [24:14] We do 190 million snowflake queries a [24:16] day and we ingest a call. You got to [24:18] slow me 190 million million queries a [24:21] day and a lot of queries and a pabyte of [24:26] compute intensive workload which is [24:28] great to burn down credits out of like 5 [24:32] was the question I was 190 million out [24:42] also you also punch above your weight [24:45] figures in revenue, right? But and [24:49] billion. Four and a half. Yeah. But [24:53] you punch above below your weight class, [24:55] right? Sometimes you have everyone in [24:56] the world uses you and you have no [25:00] than your ARR, right? Yeah. I I I think [25:05] And part of my own discovery over the [25:07] last 2 years has been in figuring out [25:10] what do different partners need. Yeah. [25:12] Jeremy, for example, honestly brings us [25:19] he really needs is deep technical help [25:28] And so figuring out what different [25:29] partners need is part of the challenge. [25:35] aligning both who is inside Snowflake [25:38] helping them with what they need at a [25:40] broad level. I assume one way or another [25:42] through partners sis big guys. The [25:46] touched by partners of some form, right? [25:50] be direct. [25:52] A lot of it. A lot of it. So, we have [25:54] some companies that had their own [25:56] engineering crew and will implement [25:58] their stuff. Yeah. We have a great [26:00] professional services team that will go [26:02] implement some projects, but the vast [26:05] integrators. So, just and just because [26:07] it is an interesting topic. I appreciate [26:11] busy running running a company of stuff [26:13] like how much of your mental bandwidth [26:15] goes into like partners in the ecosystem [26:17] versus all the rest. How much time do [26:19] you have of your scarce time to to that [26:21] part? I actually spent a fair amount of [26:24] time on partners especially the gsis in [26:27] this world that is changing so rapidly [26:30] yeah with things like agentai a number [26:32] of them have pretty amazing solutions [26:34] that they have built several of them [26:36] Infosys for example [26:38] are cognizant have very large [26:40] engineering teams have built substantial [26:43] software engineering projects so working [26:45] with the accenturers the deoids the cap [26:50] spend some time on that scale of motion. [26:53] The bulk of my time though goes first of [26:57] the time. A lot of the time goes with [26:59] the product team and I spend like the [27:02] remaining time with partners and the go [27:06] different topic actually. But I just [27:12] of folks that have these inside [27:15] one of these. I want to be one of the [27:18] like on the other side. You need trusted [27:19] partners, right? And everybody ends up [27:22] with an inner circle that like the game [27:27] software build whatever you want but [27:31] relationship how can I get one of these [27:32] special relationships sometimes in some [27:34] ecosystems are a little mchaveli and I [27:38] how do I how do I get into the inner [27:40] circle [27:42] first of all this problem of how we make [27:45] partners successful is something we take [27:47] seriously and I think there is a lot of [27:50] similar similarity between how we take [27:53] new products that my team builds whether [27:57] we have a great data clean room solution [27:59] limited applicability. some set of [28:01] customers had customers wanted not [28:03] everyone and so we have now a very [28:07] rational model for how do we invest in [28:10] these things I tell my own engineers you [28:16] wonderful we have one person yeah to [28:18] take that product to market go make me 5 [28:23] person and similarly with partners [28:26] that we can support because the sales [28:28] team is busy selling snowflake and the [28:32] limited coverage. And so what I tell [28:35] folks is there needs to be alignment. [28:37] For example, Snowflake investing money [28:39] in a partner in a startup without having [28:43] a serious intent to work on a [28:45] partnership to drive more joined revenue [28:52] for here is how you grow your company. [28:55] It is aligned investment. Similarly, [28:57] when it comes to partnerships, [28:59] we are increasingly headed to a place [29:01] where we have a like limited number of [29:03] them, dozens, but we invest [29:06] significantly. Yeah. And the thing that [29:08] I always tell any partner is unless [29:14] career and future depends on you [29:19] for every company. Yeah. You never [29:21] believe a company that says like, ""Hey, [29:24] money on me."" They just want your money. [29:26] Yeah. Yeah. So I mean getting in the [29:27] inner circle if you commit that [29:30] commitment shows through. You will build [29:32] relationships by virtue of the fact that [29:34] you know you are 100% committed to the [29:39] know how do you get into an inner [29:41] circle? I mean one of the things I wish [29:44] in Silicon Valley probably 35 years now. [29:51] not too good at it either. Yeah. Are you [29:52] social? One of my old old bosses, Joe [30:03] I take time?"" Oh, he takes time he takes [30:04] time out every week to keep in touch [30:06] with people. And uh there are very few [30:09] benefits of getting old, but one of them [30:10] is the older you are, you know, if [30:15] temptation is only to go to somebody [30:16] when you need them, which is actually [30:18] the worst time to go to them. So the [30:20] other advice I give I mean I I know a [30:22] lot of people that do with Snowflake [30:23] like I used to play soccer with Tierry [30:25] at Oracle. Yeah. Mike Spiser used to [30:28] work for me back at Veritas. He was the [30:31] asking him for money. So these [30:33] relationships are precious. So keep in [30:36] touch with more people. You Yeah. I [30:40] with the world narrowing and getting [30:41] broader or something but it maybe it [30:43] goes like this at some point, right? It [30:44] it starts broad then it seems to narrow [30:47] at a certain point in your career, [30:48] right? And then things get bigger and [30:50] then you end up at a certain level where [30:53] lesson regardless of what age you are. [30:56] Yeah. You matter. Your relationships [31:00] technology can help fix some issues, but [31:02] it has to come from your heart. All of [31:04] you can tell the difference between [31:07] and walks right by. And someone that [31:09] stops and looks at your eyes and goes, [31:14] Something I just want to dig into before [31:15] we run out of time. [31:19] Your key power users for in both spaces. [31:22] Okay. The data analyst, the data [31:23] engineer at Snowflake or describe your [31:25] key user and the DevOps engineer [31:29] at observe 12 months from now or pick [31:31] wherever you want in the age of AI in [31:33] 2026. [31:34] How is their job going to change? [31:38] from 2021 to 2025. Maybe the job was I [31:41] got better and better at my snowflake [31:43] queries and my workflows and is it going [31:45] to change in the next 12 to 18 months? I [31:47] think a data engineer currently spent a [31:49] lot of time setting up pipelines [31:51] manually figuring out what the right [31:54] column names are going to be or [31:55] extracting data and validating it, [31:58] writing tests for it or doing painful [32:00] migrations from one kind of database [32:02] over to to move that data into [32:04] Snowflake. [32:08] cursor style coding of these data [32:12] engineering workflows. I think things [32:14] like being able to extract metadata so [32:16] that the data set that you extract is [32:18] almost self-describing so that AI can [32:21] get to work on it. I think that is going [32:24] to be significantly different for data [32:26] engineers in a year, 2 years than what [32:33] actually writing writing the code. [32:39] hours doing data analysis. Literally [32:41] thousands of hours writing SQL queries, [32:43] making mistakes, figuring it out. And I [32:48] line long SQL queries, you just a lot of [32:50] detail. Yeah. On the other hand, I think [32:54] what that data analyst instead of [32:56] writing millions of variations of [32:59] basically similar queries is now going [33:07] give semantic context to what does this [33:09] query mean what does this data set mean [33:11] so that again that data becomes more AI [33:14] ready more self-describing so that now [33:17] tools like the uh the chat GPD research [33:23] with with these data sets so I think the [33:25] job goes from I needed to individually [33:29] write every line of code to I do the [33:32] meta work that lets my business users [33:34] get value from their data straight out [33:38] be doing geometrically more queries next [33:43] data. Well, we absolutely want more [33:47] business users to be going against the [33:49] data for data to be easier to access, [33:51] for people to be able to stitch things [33:55] reason why we are optimistic about our [33:57] future as a company because all of the [33:59] data that makes AI interesting is in [34:02] Snowflake. Yeah, I not a total expert, [34:05] but I would imagine even with as wildly [34:08] powerful and successful as Snowflake is [34:13] for I want to get it information out of [34:15] my data. I want reports. I want queries. [34:17] I want to figure out things out of my [34:18] data. And I think if you get if you [34:20] become cursoresque [34:23] you might have to answer 10 times as [34:25] many questions for your organ which is a [34:26] good thing but it might be very [34:29] correct and this also is going to [34:31] increase the pressure for where do you [34:32] create value and remember at the end of [34:34] the day the CFO that looks at the [34:36] snowflake bill goes like wait this is [34:39] the second largest bill after AWS [34:43] you got to earn it even more next year [34:44] you got you got to earn value from the [34:50] been a while since I lived it but boy of [34:52] staring at the dashboards staring at the [34:57] little while as a founder but whether [35:01] region can AI go so far as to not only [35:05] but can it wake me up and propose the [35:11] smart enough technically but that would [35:18] 90% sure this is the answer. [35:21] Jeremy, would you like me to execute [35:23] that and your super smart engineer just [35:26] decides with all of that collected, this [35:28] is the action, right? You know my search [35:30] ads team at Google had auto experiment [35:33] scaling which is an experiment would go [35:35] out to one process, one machine, then [35:38] two machines, then a whole data center, [35:40] then globally and we would look at [35:41] metrics every time and faster than [35:44] humans could. It would revert the thing [35:46] if it saw some significant deviation. [35:48] Yeah, every change that goes out at [35:50] Snowflake goes is guarded by what we [35:52] call parameters that get turned on in [35:54] order to enable a feature. 100% [36:03] bit of bootstrapping required because [36:07] doing the root cause analysis, you then [36:09] have better investigation history. So [36:11] when then when something comes in, yeah, [36:14] that the troubleshooting is going to be [36:15] on rails. The the biggest problem we [36:16] have right now is you see a problem, you [36:19] before. Actually, you have. You just [36:21] never root caused it. You never [36:23] documented it properly. And by the way, [36:26] find it. Yeah, I mean go I tell you, you [36:29] know, I if there were no DevOps issues, [36:40] just as a batter kills you. It just I [36:47] can never be perfect at golf, but I [36:48] guess you can never be perfect at [36:49] resource contention and memory leaks. [36:51] But man, I just this stuff just I would [36:54] love it if AI solves all this for us [36:56] magically. We never have to think about [36:57] these things. Yeah, we want to build [36:59] features, not fix problems. I mean, [37:03] over time. Did we get everything we both [37:04] wanted? Do we get everything out of [37:05] this? All right, thanks everybody.",2025-06-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwAlXvfhgFo
"Blurring GTM with AI Agents. This is the ""kid in the candy store"" era, where unified platforms are replacing siloed sales and support functions by leveraging AI to create a single, conversational customer experience.","1. Actionable Sales Implementations:

5:58 [Leadership / Sales Ops] To increase the percentage of time reps spend with customers (currently 25-35%), use AI to automate administrative tasks and improve account coverage, which is often only 40% of assigned accounts. (5:58)
10:44 [Sales Ops / Support] Automate Tier 1 support by implementing an AI agent. To do this, feed the agent your documentation, support ticket history, and knowledge base. This can solve 40-45% of tickets with AI. (10:44)
12:02 [Sales Ops / Knowledge Management] Implement a second AI agent that identifies knowledge gaps by analyzing unstructured data (like support conversations) and then automatically drafts new knowledge base articles for human review and approval. (12:02)
12:53 [Sales Ops / Support] To set up a customer support AI agent in a few hours, sync your knowledge base, all support ticket history, website data (including hundreds of web pages and pricing), and community answers into the agent. (12:53)
16:53 [SDR / AE] Shift outreach from ""personalized"" (segment-based) to ""personal."" Use AI to research a prospect's specific, recent activities (e.g., statements in an earnings call, recent posts) and craft an email that addresses a single, timely problem you can solve. (16:53)
24:51 [SDR / Sales Ops] Implement a prospecting agent that analyzes your entire customer base to identify the best prospects to go after and can help set up meetings with them. (24:51)
25:02 [Marketing / Sales Ops] Use a content agent to analyze your content distribution. The agent can recommend the best channel for a piece of content and help reformat it for that channel (e.g., turn a blog post into a YouTube script). (25:02)
33:58 [Sales Ops / Leadership] Onboard an AI agent like a new employee by providing it with a unified set of data: your brand voice, tone, ideal customer profile, knowledge base articles, competitive differentiation, and company history. This context makes the agent more effective. (33:58)
34:34 [SDR / AE] When using a generic AI tool for a sales task, improve its output by providing context in your prompt. Start by defining your role, your company, your customers, and then ask your specific question. (34:34)

2. Core AI-Era Sales Conclusions:

5:43 [Conclusion] For the first time, AI makes it possible to move previously immovable go-to-market metrics, such as the low percentage of time reps spend with customers or poor account coverage rates. (5:43)
18:12 [Conclusion] The old sales playbook focused on increasing volume (leads, pipeline) is obsolete. As AI explodes the volume of outreach, the only way to succeed is to focus on conversion through highly personal and relevant communication. (18:12)
23:11 [Conclusion] The future of work involves both co-pilots and agents. Co-pilots are assistants that help you do your work, while agents are autonomous systems that do the work for you, even when you are not there. (23:11)
30:44 [Conclusion] The lines between sales, marketing, and service are blurring. A customer interacting with an AI agent will ask sales, service, and marketing questions in one conversation, forcing companies to break down internal silos and provide a unified experience. (30:44)
31:10 [Conclusion] Platforms with unified data will win over point solution agents. To answer a customer's full range of questions, an agent needs the complete context of the customer journey, which only an integrated platform can provide. (31:10)
31:42 [Conclusion] AI enables generalists to perform tasks that once required specialists. A marketer can now edit video, translate content, or manage social channels, which will change the composition and skill sets of go-to-market teams. (31:42)
37:19 [Conclusion] The way customers find information is shifting from ""search, click, consume"" to a conversational model. Websites must evolve from being static information repositories to being carriers for an interactive AI that customers can talk to. (37:19)

3.Key Quotes:

17:52 ""It is not volume of content. It is really how personal it is that is going to drive conversion.""
23:11 ""Co-pilots help you do work and agents do work for you.""
46:56 ""If you are not excited about the candy store age, you have the wrong team.""","AI and The Future of Sales, Marketing & CS with HubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan","[00:03] years, of course, this is a [00:05] unprecedented level of change, but [00:07] change has been the constant and you [00:11] kid in the candy store right now looking [00:13] at all of the new ways in which we can [00:16] help customers and so you have to [00:18] embrace it and when people around you [00:22] are learning, you are answering [00:26] interesting you said kid in the candy [00:29] bar. Like sometimes people get mad when [00:32] I say this. Especially when I talk to [00:33] product teams or engineering teams. If [00:36] the candy store age, you have the wrong [00:38] team. They should be excited. They [00:41] should be going home at night and [00:42] screwing around and coming up with they [00:44] should be doing internal hackathons even [00:47] They should be like finally some cool [00:52] team. The last 5 years were boring. We [00:55] were doing the same playbook and we were [00:57] trying to push the same. Exactly. So if [01:03] sign.

[01:29] [Music] [01:35] Y, thanks for coming back to Sass. Yeah, [01:37] so good to be back here. Great. [01:42] anyone actually better to tie to that [01:46] changing. I mean there are if we look at [01:48] the public SAS companies that are like [01:53] better than HubSpot but so much change [01:55] right so much change so much change so I [01:56] want to get into that first of all who [01:58] in the audience is a HubSpot customer [02:01] thank you so much good most of us all [02:07] a little bit of time for questions [02:08] because we have so many customers so a [02:10] couple folks want questions we will save [02:12] some time so think about some questions [02:14] hey first off I have been to SAS for the [02:17] last decade. I came in person when I was [02:20] a dropout. I did the video one with you. [02:23] This is incredible. Congratulations. And [02:27] the insights that you add to go to [02:29] market leaders is just incredible. [02:31] Congratulations. Thank you. Thanks for [02:40] the pre2020 era. Yes. where it was [02:44] same thing, right? Yes. And then then [02:47] there was this weird era from 2020 to [02:49] 2023. Like first of all, we were all [02:51] geniuses. Like we talked about before, [02:52] we were all geniuses in 2020, 2020. Were [02:55] we? Yes. I completely agree. I was [02:57] listening backstage and we thought that [02:58] we were good, but we were going with the [03:00] same playbook and getting the excesses [03:03] of that playbook. That is gone. Gone. [03:09] year was great. like in terms of [03:11] quality, but it was a low point in terms [03:13] of this transition vibe. Like people [03:15] were still feeling bad for themselves [03:19] Listen, it is not easy at HubSpot today, [03:26] we are working harder to get to the same [03:29] kind of output. I was just agreeing with [03:34] and for a company like HubSpot we [03:37] absolutely want to keep all of you [03:38] existing customers happy and we are [03:42] reimagining what go to market looks like [03:50] anxiety anxiety yeah and how since you [03:53] do how are you I see it in what you [03:56] write I certainly see in what Darmsh has [03:58] done right but how are you helping [04:02] create urgency at the company because I [04:03] would say of all the public companies, [04:05] HubSpot seems to be executing the [04:14] a tough question. How do how have you [04:15] helped create the urgency? [04:18] It is not fast enough. And my team will [04:20] hear this from me every single day. [04:22] Look, I think November 2022 is such a [04:25] pivotal moment. AI was there before. [04:28] Generative AI was there before, but [04:30] November [04:31] 2022 showed us that you can now interact [04:35] in a very different way with technology [04:37] and get more done. And so for us coming [04:40] into 2023, we just finished the annual [04:42] planning process. We had the road map. [04:44] We knew exactly what we were doing. We [04:46] came into January 2023 and we said [04:49] pivot. That entire road map that we just [04:52] planned for the last 3 to 4 months is [04:55] not going to be what we are building in [04:57] 2023. And so we pivoted our entire [05:00] company at the beginning of January [05:02] 2023. We started building whole set of [05:05] new features. The first set of features [05:07] that Dhmesh helped us launch that our [05:09] teams launched was March 2023. We [05:12] launched our first chat spot now called [05:15] co-pilot in March 2023. Then we launched [05:20] a number of content features in March [05:23] 2023. So it was like immediately [05:28] has been easy. There was just a lot of [05:29] question. I think you mentioned this [05:31] 2023 and 24, lot more skeptical voices, [05:35] a lot more, yeah, this is going to be [05:37] like every other big tech fad that was [05:40] out there. This is just going to go [05:41] away. But I think internally we felt [05:43] like this is the first time that some [05:47] immovable metrics in go to market can be [05:56] There are things in sales where what is [05:58] the percentage of time that your sales [06:00] team spends in front of customers. I [06:03] want you to think about this number [06:05] because this number has been 25% to 35% [06:10] not been able to move the time we spend [06:14] in front of customers because we are [06:16] trying to do all these administrative [06:22] account coverage that every single [06:24] salesperson has. You give your [06:26] salespeople 100 accounts. Guess what [06:29] they cover [06:31] actually? Maybe 40. They cover 40 out of [06:34] 100. 40% of the accounts get better [06:36] coverage. So there have been these key [06:42] been able to move that AI is now going [06:45] to help us move. And so for us it has [06:47] been just pivoting towards that and I [06:50] would say that it comes from the top. [06:53] One of the reasons like I do a five [06:55] minute video for our entire company. We [06:58] call it a weekly rap and I send it out [07:12] seeing real customer value and so it has [07:14] to come from the top. So those of you [07:17] who are leading organizations, go to [07:19] market teams, your founders, you have to [07:21] lead from the front and you have to [07:23] believe that there is value for your [07:25] customers and you have to be able to [07:26] showcase that value for customers. Yeah. [07:31] dig in on it, but we were chatting [07:35] want I might have misqued you so reframe [07:36] it but you said something to me that [07:41] fairly stunning which was that on [07:44] product development side on coding yes [07:48] cursor and others whatever the suite is [07:51] have a you almost have too much product [07:53] to ship into production right is it that [07:56] different than a year ago I might be [07:57] slightly misquing you but it was [07:59] dramatically higher output of product so [08:01] I completely agree with what you said [08:03] just a little bit earlier which is [08:05] coding and support. These two use cases [08:08] have sat on product market fit with AI. [08:16] behind. I think coding and support are [08:19] done, right? Like we know that there is [08:22] product market fit. What I was [08:23] mentioning is that we we started with [08:26] the first generation of co-pilots with [08:29] coding and it had some level of [08:32] productivity. there was some value in [08:36] generation with things like cursor with [08:39] cloud code and obviously MCP and the [08:42] combination of all of that is certainly [08:45] driving the productivity within our [08:47] engineering organization. We track what [08:50] percentage of our teams use AI every [08:53] single day. Within engineering it is [08:56] 95%. Using one form of agentic code [09:02] generation every single day and that [09:04] means we have to be even more careful [09:09] velocity of shipping something as new [09:12] features. It is what is the value. [09:16] about this but the business model is [09:20] shipped and how much you can get for [09:22] that product. it is where is there value [09:24] and how much work is getting done [09:29] more focused on usage and value that we [09:33] generate through all of those [09:38] minute because you get it but not [09:44] understand how good it is now with AI. [09:54] have to be trained like you usually do [09:58] going to be out of the box 10% in seesat [10:00] y and for depending on how and maybe [10:03] deflect 40 to 50% of the issues and [10:06] maybe resolve another 20 to 30% of [10:09] routine questions you still need humans [10:11] in those cases right you do but the an a [10:14] for an average question a great [10:17] well-trained A is better than a human [10:21] and maybe why is support a great use [10:25] documentation and anywhere there is [10:27] documentation, anywhere there is data, [10:29] anywhere there is history and anywhere [10:32] there is a known amount of finite work, [10:36] AI is a great way to solve that. And if [10:40] you take the tiers of support, tier one [10:44] support tickets, you should not be using [10:46] humans at all because you have [10:48] documentation, you have a support [10:52] can get all of this. And so I think [10:54] internally we started using AI for our [10:58] tier 1 support tickets, but we had a [11:00] counterbalancing measure which is sees. [11:08] or improving your customer satisfaction. [11:10] So those two metrics go hand inand for [11:16] to 45% solved with AI. Now last year at [11:23] launched customer agent and the use case [11:25] is support tickets and we have over 200 [11:29] customers now on customer agent 52% [11:32] average resolution rate with AI and we [11:36] have customers that have between 70 and [11:39] 80% of their tickets getting resolved [11:42] with AI and we are like watching the [11:45] patterns of these customers really [11:46] closely what is the difference between [11:48] someone who is solveing having 40% with [11:50] AI and 80% with AI. It comes down to [11:55] knowledge and knowledge based articles. [11:58] And now we launched a second agent which [12:02] actually identifies the knowledge gap [12:04] and says from your unstructured data [12:11] write a knowledge article and AI writes [12:13] that knowledgebased article and gives it [12:15] back to the team to look at approve and [12:17] that is way to improve that overall rate [12:21] but 70% 80% resolution is happening [12:30] 15 to 18 months we have seen such a huge [12:33] improvement. And what is I probably [12:36] how much training how much time does it [12:39] take me to get there in HubSpot like how [12:41] is it an hour two hours is it doing an [12:48] and it really starts with having well [12:51] doumented knowledge bases and [12:53] history that has taken is get your [12:55] knowledge base into the agent get all of [12:59] your support tickets and history into [13:00] the agent sync up all of your website [13:04] data. You can read now hundreds of web [13:07] pages in matter of seconds. So sync up [13:09] your pricing data, all of the website [13:13] information, sync up your community [13:14] answers, all of that stuff. Now if you [13:17] have that readily available, it is a [13:19] matter of few hours to get that in few [13:20] hours, then it is a question of [13:23] reinforcing are you happy with it? But [13:27] do you want handoff to humans? Because [13:30] not all AI. AI is augmenting your [13:34] support teams to drive a higher level of [13:37] productivity. So where do you hand off [13:39] and how do you make sure that handoff [13:41] between agents and humans and sometimes [13:49] Yeah. And where that this handoff the do [13:52] you think that ratio will keep going up? [13:54] Do you think you it will can go up to [13:55] 80% 90% automated as we get better over [13:57] the because the rate of change is so [13:59] fast. the rate of change is fast. I [14:01] think that there will still be a portion [14:04] which is going to be for humans to [14:14] value in working with agents reinforcing [14:17] the learning but also having humans [14:20] really read the particular case and be [14:23] involved. So I think there will still be [14:25] humans augmenting the work that AI is [14:27] doing and vice versa. So handoffs are [14:32] in general not just in support. I think [14:35] AI working with humans and handoffs [14:38] being seamless is going to be important [14:41] for every function within go to market [14:44] that is customerf facing. What do you [14:46] and I want to dig into some HubSpot AI [14:48] stuff that I have slides next but let me [14:53] know if you heard the story I gave [14:54] backstage. Yeah. Of a leading B2B [14:56] company where the SDR asked me if I [14:58] wanted to meet at Saster next week. This [15:00] I got an email this morning. Okay. Hey [15:04] Saster next week. Next week. Okay. This [15:06] morning. We want to meet next week. This [15:08] is a leading company. When you hear that [15:11] in the age of AI, [15:13] is that going to be gone next year? Is [15:15] there a role for that human? Because [15:20] we even need that type [15:22] of pretty low performing knowledge [15:25] professor? Like how do you react [15:26] managing an organization that in general [15:29] and with like how does that how do you [15:31] sales background that is egregious. I [15:35] but I could tell you three other story [15:36] cuz people ask me Jason why does this [15:38] always happen to you? You know people [15:42] because I know I just look I just enjoy [15:50] going to put the vendor absolutely but I [15:51] but it happens every week I get an email [15:55] with AI? Look the the biggest change [16:01] more to get your customers and prospects [16:11] of outreach. And how are you going to [16:14] cut through that noise? Not by first of [16:16] all if you have like egregiously wrong [16:18] information like oh your conference is [16:22] even get 10 seconds in that email and [16:24] you become a case study for what not to [16:25] do but then it becomes a what does it [16:28] actually take for a CEO like you to open [16:32] that email and to engage. It better be [16:36] exceptionally targeted. It better be [16:39] personal not personaliz personalized. [16:44] for a very long time, which is you [16:46] segment your customers. You take your [16:48] customers and you personalize your data [16:49] and send it to everybody in that [16:53] needs to be personal. It needs to be [16:56] Jason. Here are the four posts that you [16:58] did. Here is why I can help you with [17:01] this single problem that you have and [17:03] let me get 10 minutes with you. Yeah. I [17:05] sometimes get and I was telling our [17:07] sales team yesterday that in the last [17:21] actually said something very specific [17:23] about what I talked in the earnings two [17:25] weeks ago and how they can specifically [17:27] help that caught my attention. So I [17:30] think junk and irrelevant content and [17:34] both humans and agents not doing their [17:36] job, yes, is not going to cut through. [17:38] But humans and agents doing their job, [17:41] understanding your very specific context [17:45] and sending you a personal message is [17:48] what will cut through. And we are going [17:52] not volume of content. It is really how [17:55] personal it is that is going to drive [18:05] increase the volume of leads, increase [18:07] the amount of pipeline, increase [18:12] volume. It really needs to be focused on [18:15] conversion because the volume is [18:17] exploding. Now it is all about how do [18:19] you convert and how can you be very [18:21] relevant, very personal so that you can [18:24] make that connection. And that is what [18:26] AI is going to help. It has to be [18:31] still get these ter like SAS for next [18:37] is great first email, terrible second [18:42] the earnings [18:43] calls doing this, but I saw you have [18:45] this one issue around personalization of [18:53] this? And then I get the worst email [18:54] after that because all the steps have to [18:56] be per have to be S tier now to get the [19:00] question becomes how is there a handoff [19:02] is the second email written by a human [19:07] throughout the journey you now have the [19:10] ability to know what your prospect wants [19:13] your customer needs what the last [19:16] conversation was. If you got that first [19:18] email answered, what was the very [19:21] specific point that they were interested [19:23] in? How can you go deeper? I started in [19:25] the industry in sales more than 20 years [19:28] ago at this company called Seabull. This [19:30] was the original CRM company. And before [19:33] every conversation with the customer, my [19:36] preparation was like 2 hours. I would [19:38] read 10Ks. I would read 10 cues. I would [19:41] look at transcripts. I would look at [19:42] anything that was publicly available [19:44] about that company, their challenges, [19:46] their strategy. And I would ask very [19:48] pointed questions. And asking questions [19:52] was the biggest thing that I learned [19:54] early in sales. And I think that has [19:56] become even more important in the age of [19:59] AI. How can you ask the most relevant [20:02] questions on what your customer is [20:04] facing right now so that you can get the [20:12] is getting the response. Every meeting [20:18] focus and you have to be just brilliant [20:20] at it. Yeah. I worry that as our AIS get [20:23] better for a while the handoff for human [20:26] might get worse. It might get worse [20:30] email I got. It was basically an email [20:31] like this. It was like, Jason, I saw [20:33] that you just did this interview with [20:36] really like the point she made about [20:38] agent to agent conversations. I have a [20:40] way to create your entire podcast [20:43] automation for you. I can create the [20:44] clip. I can redo it. I can do everything [20:48] it for you. I can do it. I could even do [20:52] problem I have. It is great. That is [20:57] have no time, but if you can do this for [21:01] is my response. You won the deal. I get [21:04] the human response back. Oh, what what [21:06] is your podcast and how many do you do? [21:10] Go to Apple, go to our blog, go to [21:15] your podcast and what do you do? That [21:18] was You asked the question. That was the [21:19] human responding to the AI. The AI was [21:24] busy. Take my money. Yeah, just just I [21:29] Take my money, but not a great handoff. [21:36] through it, but I wanted to break out [21:41] what you think HubSpot will do with AI [21:43] in whatever time frame, 12 months, 9 [21:45] months, end of the year. Y you can talk [21:48] a little bit about today, but what are [21:50] you really excit what are you going to [21:51] be we going to be able to automate in [21:52] HubSpot like in the next 12 months that [21:56] maybe a step back took you back to the [21:57] journey of January 2023. Yeah. I think [22:00] couple of important decisions that we [22:04] going to be one product which is an AI [22:06] first customer platform and that is an [22:09] important decision to make because there [22:11] were a lot of folks building an AI skew [22:14] with an AI price and like a separate [22:17] thing that you would do and I think for [22:19] us it is did anybody buy black and white [22:22] TV after color TV came out the answer is [22:25] no. So you went after AI there is no [22:29] product that should not have AI in it. [22:32] And so I think that was the fundamental [22:35] way in which we approached our product [22:36] roadmap and to simplify this very [22:39] complex and comprehensive slide we embed [22:41] AI in everything that we do. So every [22:43] product that we have has AI features in [22:45] it and we have a co-pilot which is a [22:47] digital assistant which means any go to [22:49] market employee should be able to ask [22:52] questions of the co-pilot to be able to [22:54] get answers and then we have agents that [22:56] do work for you. Now in the industry [23:02] what is a co-pilot what is an agent? Do [23:08] agents. And the simplified version is [23:11] you actually need both. Co-pilots help [23:14] you do work and agents do work for you. [23:22] what is happening with technology [23:24] because forever software and technology [23:37] all the application companies so that we [23:39] can help someone sitting in their seat [23:42] to be able to do more with their time [23:44] and that has been the last generation of [23:47] technology and software. I think what is [23:49] happening now is that you are not [23:52] constrained and technology is getting [23:54] more work done for you when you may not [23:58] be there. If you have a customer agent [24:02] website question or the question that [24:04] comes into you might happen at the [24:06] middle of the night when nobody is [24:13] is how is work getting done? And I give [24:16] that context because we believe that you [24:18] need both co-pilots and agents. And if [24:22] to do is that we launched four agents [24:25] last year. We added one more agent this [24:30] fit. We just want to make sure that [24:34] leveraging an agent is getting clear, [24:38] consistent, repeated value from those [24:43] agent, it should like clockwork be able [24:47] to solve your tier one and maybe even [24:51] prospecting agent, it should look at [24:53] your entire customer base and be able to [24:55] tell you what are the best prospects to [24:57] go after and even help you set up [24:59] meetings with those prospects. Content [25:02] agent should look at the distribution of [25:03] the content that you have and be able to [25:06] say, ""Here is the best channel to put [25:13] for YouTube. It should be able to help [25:18] trying to prove. And what is interesting [25:20] is that in the world of applications [25:24] before it was somewhat predictable. You [25:27] go in, you point, you click and you can [25:29] see what the customers are doing. I [25:35] patterns. And so all of us in the [25:37] industry have to be very curious about [25:40] what those usage patterns are because we [25:44] technology and usage in the last 10 [25:49] obsessed about what are they clicking? [25:52] Which ones have daily repeat usage [25:55] versus weekly repeat usage versus [26:00] the industry is there are novel neat AI [26:07] and it has this beautiful image that it [26:09] creates and then we never go back to it. [26:15] necessary. It has to go from just being [26:18] neat to being necessary to being in the [26:21] flow of everyday work in order to have [26:24] the promised transformative benefits [26:26] that we all think there is. And so [26:30] a couple questions. I want you said [26:35] products right now, right? Six [26:38] as they all have an AI and as you said [26:45] feature. [26:48] Are those products blending more into [26:54] stretch across them. the difference [26:56] between sales support marketing service [27:21] here and B2B has been in e-commerce [27:26] volume, super transactional. And in [27:28] e-commerce, the lines between sales and [27:30] support were always blurry. Y in B2B, I [27:33] buy the product often with a human and [27:35] then support handles the headaches and [27:37] customer success smooths over the bumps. [27:40] In e-commerce, when I go to buy some [27:43] cool shoes or this neat bracelet online, [27:47] I might want to buy it, I might have a [27:49] question. Is this in my size? Is this is [27:51] do you have it in gold? or I might need [27:56] things or I might come to the site for [27:59] I might need a coupon so I go back later [28:11] all these folks in the Shopify ecosystem [28:18] that is happening classic B2B is beh but [28:21] HubSpot is in this unique position where [28:23] you have all the apps. Yeah. So, I just [28:27] think this idea that I talk to this SDR [28:30] that thinks Sasser is next week and then [28:32] I have to talk to an AE and then I have [28:37] the data and learn like the customer [28:42] customer wants one experience and the [28:44] interesting thing in e-commerce this [28:45] just literally changed a couple months [28:49] gamer, but all the gamer Anyone have a [28:51] secret chair? No game. Not enough [28:54] YouTube. They all have these secret [28:58] stream all day, I always wanted one [29:00] you. And you can brand them on the spot. [29:09] chair or something. So, I had to switch [29:27] question. This little quote from John [29:29] Keys at this. Totally. But not that many [29:32] in B2B have all the whole stack. Right. [29:36] here because I think two things are [29:37] happening. One is that the usage [29:40] patterns are creating a blur of lines [29:44] between the different functions in B2B [29:46] just like it created in B2C and like [29:49] other places. And this is exactly right [29:51] like we launched our customer agent and [29:53] we were specifically thinking about the [29:59] watching like how are customers using [30:01] this agent and what is the daily usage [30:03] patterns and what is interesting is that [30:07] is using a customer support agent [30:14] next event that is getting thrown the [30:16] next webinar that you can attend and so [30:21] service product and I now can only ask [30:32] your customer and I have a service [30:35] question, a marketing question, a sales [30:37] question. So, you literally cannot do [30:40] that when you put an agent out there. [30:42] And this is one of the realizations that [30:44] we had. the lines are blurring and at [30:46] the end of the day you serve your [30:48] customer. Your customer does not need to [30:56] our industry. It is now possible to do. [30:58] I do think the lines are blurring and in [31:00] order to do that the level of [31:02] documentation, the level of history, the [31:06] full context of the customer journey [31:10] one of the reasons why platforms will [31:13] continue to win. point agents will not [31:16] win in this whole race that we are in. [31:20] subtle thing that is happening which is [31:22] we have in B2B software always focused [31:26] on providing technology for specialists. [31:30] BDR has a tool, a pre-salesperson has a [31:33] tool, a solution consultant has a tool, [31:35] a salesperson has a tool, a content [31:37] manager has a tool, a video editor has a [31:42] tools for specialists and what AI is [31:45] going to help us do is to enable [31:47] generalists in marketing. You might not [31:51] be the translation expert but you can [31:54] now translate. You might not be the [31:57] video editing expert but you can edit [31:59] your videos right now. You might not be [32:02] specified like social channel media [32:05] expert but AI is going to help you do [32:09] to more generalists that can then [32:12] leverage technology to be able to do [32:16] Yeah. Maybe just two thoughts. One about [32:20] insight here, your insight. But I also [32:31] lot are just CRM because HubSpot owns [32:33] CRM for this community. But I maybe in [32:35] 2024 I might use two vendors or three [32:37] vendors. Y I feel [32:40] like in 2026 I might be like if I just [32:46] my AI leaving my platform and going to a [32:49] different AI. I want this whole thing to [32:52] be transparent to the customer. So I [32:54] think I in ideal world I want one app [32:57] that does it all and I think I want to [33:03] going to assume that we have the ability [33:08] fight for it. Because while the premise [33:10] is that point agents cannot solve more [33:14] than point questions and you as a [33:19] answer all the questions for your [33:20] customers. That is given. Yeah. If you [33:23] peel back the onion, think about what [33:24] does an agent need? An agent needs to be [33:27] onboarded just like your employee needs [33:29] to be onboarded. When your employee [33:31] joins your company, what do you do in [33:33] the first week for that employee? You [33:35] provide your products, your ideal [33:38] customer profile, your brand voice, your [33:41] tone, your competitive differentiation, [33:46] training your employee with all of that [33:49] context so that the employee can [33:52] contribute, you know, meaningfully to [33:58] onboard an agent, you provide the same [34:00] thing. Your brand, your tone, your [34:03] knowledge base articles, your history, [34:05] your ideal customer profiles. And when [34:07] you do that with the most exhaustive and [34:10] unified set of data, then your agents [34:12] can actually perform better. And so you [34:15] really have to start thinking about what [34:17] is this required to leverage AI. It is [34:21] more unified data. It is data across [34:26] context about you your company. I prompt [34:34] I probably do tens of prompts but I have [34:37] a generic one which is this is my role. [34:40] This is what I do for HubSpot. This is [34:42] our company. This is our customers. Now [34:45] I have a question for you. like that [34:52] as part of my prompt and then I write [34:54] the second part of the prompt which is a [34:56] more specific question and your [34:58] applications need to do the same thing. [35:02] every time you use an agent. It should [35:04] just be available for you and that is [35:06] the difference. Yeah. And just for folks [35:09] that maybe are behind here, this point [35:12] that I highlighted, Yam already brought [35:13] it up, but this the team started using [35:17] it beyond service is pretty profound. Y [35:20] our own little AI 140,000 chats. Yeah, [35:24] it was just I thought people would ask [35:25] about what Yamin said when she was at [35:30] pitches, hundreds of board sections. [35:34] been a lot of therapy sessions with [35:35] Digital Jason about their business [35:36] slowing down. There have been a lot of [35:38] conversations about whether they should [35:39] fire a CRO or a CMO and RAI which I [35:50] fact that HubSpot at their scale can see [35:53] it already do more than service if [36:02] not in the old one of the old Saster [36:04] posts which I know you would agree with [36:05] is everyone needs to do customer support [36:14] learn these, you learn like things that [36:17] you knew but were a little different. [36:19] With AI, the customers take you places [36:21] you did not expect it to go, right? [36:25] obsessed about usage patterns. What are [36:26] they clicking? What are they returning [36:30] between neat and necessary. Yeah. Daily [36:36] pattern that you have to like really [36:38] follow this whole thing of every company [36:40] needs a website, every company now needs [36:44] happening in the previous generation is [36:46] you search and then you clicked and then [36:50] you consume information. That is the [36:57] couple of decades, search is gone. Like [37:03] information anymore. AI overviews are [37:05] actually providing answers. So waiting [37:08] for search to lead traffic to your [37:10] website is gone and that is one thing. [37:13] The other pattern that is emerging is [37:16] that it is not search click and consume. [37:19] It is have a conversation. That is the [37:26] mode of a completely different pattern [37:28] which is all about ask a question and [37:34] just asking a question in your natural [37:37] language and getting an answer. And [37:41] means a lot of things in go to market [37:43] has to change based on that. It is a [37:45] huge you I now I was actually the reason [37:48] I put the slide up is the bottom part, [37:49] but now I get the bottom the top part [37:51] much better, right? Which is the whole [37:53] idea of a website is somewhat dated, [37:55] right? Website now is a carrier, a [37:57] vehicle to interact with, we can call it [38:00] an agent. The terms agent have one. I [38:02] like to just call it an AI. Yeah. It is [38:04] a carrier so that I can talk to an AI in [38:08] a variety of vehicles. Prospect, [38:09] customer, user, and have it do things. I [38:13] getting here, but if your website is a [38:16] static website with a data chat for [38:21] behind. Everyone wants to talk to their [38:23] documents to their vendors. Like they [38:25] just want to talk to these things. [38:30] interesting thing is you the other thing [38:32] I learned from RA AI not to get on a [38:35] tangent because I do want to at least [38:39] our AI work so well at Aster and I guess [38:42] this is an obvious point and some people [38:50] like Brian does but if you put one on [38:52] the HubSpot website right not everyone [38:54] knows who the CEO of HubSpot is honestly [38:56] you have 260,000 customers but a lot of [38:58] them know they will talk to Yeah. And [39:03] prompts are inherently different. Y [39:07] reading SAS for 12 years. Jason, I know [39:09] you did this thing at SAS with Y last [39:12] week and you talked about how we have to [39:24] be prompt experts in a year. Should we? [39:26] I still think there is benefit in that. [39:29] to be like so obvious and easy that the [39:32] conversation that you and I have is [39:34] going to replicate itself. I do think [39:36] that you have to be decent at writing [39:38] the context for the prompt and being [39:46] fascinating. Y All right. I want to we [39:48] got back to AI with the questions, but I [39:50] know AI is really exciting, but this one [39:52] in just in terms of helping folks learn. [39:55] Yeah. I find so many founders do not [39:58] understand partners and indirect sales. [40:01] So many partners I was literally [40:03] catching up with an up andcoming VP of [40:05] sales I know who just washed out at a [40:07] company at 30 million. Yeah. And I said [40:08] to him, ""What happened? I know you I [40:10] would recommend you in a heartbeat."" We [40:12] went into an environment that was 60% [40:14] indirect, 40% direct. You only ran [40:18] outbound, talked to the customers [40:19] myself, was pretty good at it. What [40:23] Revenue declined. Exactly. Even though [40:25] that 40% I bet he tilted the curve, [40:27] right? Yeah. Look, I think that as an [40:28] industry we got fascinated with [40:30] productled growth. Yeah. To the point [40:32] where we solve everything with [40:34] productled growth and that is not the [40:35] case in go to market. There is a sales [40:38] team and how you actually bring them to [40:40] the most productive use. There is a [40:42] whole partner ecosystem and then of [40:47] HubSpot 40% of our ARR has been [40:52] influenced by partners that is either [40:54] they are bringing us leads or they are [40:56] co-selling with our sales team and [40:59] helping them close. Those two are what [41:01] we call as influenced and if there are [41:03] HubSpot partners here thank you because [41:05] we love having you in the ecosystem and [41:10] had that 40% for from the time that we [41:24] old days a lot of these were agencies or [41:26] smaller shops. That ratio has probably [41:28] changed who they are, right? I [41:30] absolutely. So the couple of big [41:33] transformations that have happened [41:34] within our partner ecosystem. Most of [41:36] our partners, we have about 7,000 [41:38] partners and most of them started as [41:41] agencies, marketing agencies building [41:44] websites and it was great. Then as we [41:47] started expanding from marketing to [41:49] sales to service to content and building [41:52] an entire platform, we went to our [41:54] ecosystem and we said look this is the [41:58] an app to a suite to a platform and now [42:00] to an AI powered platform. So come on [42:05] time talking to them about their journey [42:09] most fulfilling things for me to see [42:11] many of them have transformed what their [42:13] organizations were to now become CRM [42:16] implementers and AI powered CRM [42:20] journey. The other part of the journey [42:22] was when we got started we were really [42:24] focused on SMB and most of our customers [42:31] customers with thousand 2,000 sometimes [42:34] 3,000 employees and our partners have [42:37] gone on that upmarket journey with us [42:41] requires a lot of focus. It requires [42:52] these numbers out here. Yeah. I think [42:54] what folks might not realize is that we [42:56] talked in the opener about modes versus [42:59] today, but at least in the past, most [43:03] HubSpot partners only work on HubSpot. [43:05] Yeah. So, if the customer goes to the [43:11] going to look at three vendors because [43:13] listen, I need help with my CRM. I need [43:14] help with my marketing. We will help [43:16] you. We deploy HubSpot. So, it is if you [43:20] not only if you ignore partners do you [43:23] maybe lose 40 to 50% of your revenue. [43:29] they have the energy they can evaluate [43:37] sell 11 11 other competitors? Not 70% of [43:41] our partners are focused very [43:46] huge moat. There are modes and there is [43:49] momentum and a lot of them are getting [43:52] disrupted. But I do think having a great [43:55] partner ecosystem is a very good mode. [43:57] Yeah. Whatever you do as founders at [44:00] least this direct thing even if you [44:03] is intuitive. Okay. I got to email [44:05] somebody get them. Study your ecosystem. [44:07] Yep. If your ecosystem is in any way [44:12] super if you go like into security or [44:16] all partners. you want to compete with [44:18] whiz and you want to sell direct in like [44:21] study at least calmly study your market [44:33] buyers but all right thanks I got more [44:35] questions but you guys have questions in [44:37] the last session Jason said that 20 to [44:40] 40% of the workforce might not make the [44:46] but Keep going. Yeah, I did say that. [44:48] Yeah, I was interested in knowing who [44:52] makes the cut at HubSpot. What skill [44:55] sets or trades or strengths are you [44:59] prioritizing for the future for those [45:01] that remain? Yeah. Curiosity and growth [45:08] And I think that I agree with with [45:14] if you think that this is going to go [45:18] yourself and developing a level of AI [45:23] the game. And so I think that is what we [45:25] are focused on within HubSpot. Thank you [45:28] so much. U first of all, thanks for the [45:33] insightful. My question is that you in [45:36] the beginning you mentioned about the [45:38] after champ release you changed the [45:40] business road map and product road map. [45:42] So what would be the good attitude that [45:45] CEO would need to have to cope with [45:48] change because things are changing [45:50] dramatically and I would like to [45:52] understand how you cope with change and [45:54] what kind of do you prepare for it. [45:56] Yeah, you just embrace it. I think if [46:00] been in this industry for 25 years, of [46:02] course, this is a unprecedented level of [46:04] change, but change has been the constant [46:08] like a kid in the candy store right now [46:11] looking at all of the new ways in which [46:13] we can help customers and so you have to [46:15] embrace it and when people around you [46:20] are learning, you are answering [46:21] questions and a lot of times this is a [46:28] know. This is like two-year-old [46:30] phenomena. So, how would we know? And [46:32] so, I think being able to role model how [46:35] you are thriving with change will [46:38] encourage others to do the same thing [46:41] with change. Thank you. For once, I want [46:44] really interesting you said kid in a [46:49] sometimes people get mad when I say [46:51] this, but when I especially when I talk [46:52] to product teams or engineering teams, [46:56] the candy store age, you have the wrong [46:57] team. They should be excited. They [47:00] should be going home at night and [47:01] screwing around and coming up, but they [47:03] should be doing internal hackathons even [47:06] They should be like, ""Finally, some cool [47:11] wrong team. The last five years were [47:13] boring. We were doing the same playbook [47:15] and we were trying to push the same [47:16] thing. Another stock What? Yeah. Another [47:20] compliance. I got a billy. Now I can do [47:24] feel that it was interesting even said [47:29] for being here. I do have a question but [47:32] the first question is hopefully Brian [47:39] not. He is but my question is involving [47:42] scaling. So, does HubSpot have a direct [47:47] competitor? I used to describe HubSpot [47:50] as the easy to use Salesforce. Yeah. And [47:54] I know you mentioned that you guys can [47:55] handle companies now with 2,000 to 3,000 [47:58] agents. Can you go enterprise? Yeah. So, [48:02] on the first part, thank you for asking [48:10] doing fantastic. and I particularly [48:13] enjoy having conversations with him and [48:16] on how we think about the segments that [48:18] we serve. We really care about ease of [48:21] use and time to value. And we think that [48:24] the segment which is 2 to 2,000 employee [48:28] segment which most of us can call it as [48:36] enterprise tools that try to fit into [48:39] solutions that you have to cobble [48:41] together and it has been underserved. We [48:44] focus on that particular segment and we [48:46] want to serve it really and we want to [48:48] be the market leader within that [48:52] an 8,500 person company, but that [48:55] product all the way up to the [48:57] enterprise. We really want to focus on [48:59] serving scaling companies really well. [49:02] Thanks. Just one followup. I have when I [49:04] my my epiphany we did we did this in [49:06] 2021 all outdoors out there. Pretty [49:08] funny. Yeah. And that was the first time [49:11] when I asked this question this type of [49:13] question nobody in 2021 now was [49:16] migrating off HubSpot. Yep. What I meant [49:17] in the old school people everyone loved [49:19] HubSpot but when HubSpot CRM was early [49:22] folks would use it and then graduate to [49:23] Salesforce. Then in 2021 I was like okay [49:29] mean, but the folks that are now at that [49:33] next level, you want to stay with them [49:37] said, HubSpot went on to HubSpot and [49:50] product scalability, but which focus [49:53] market do you really want to serve? And [50:07] right. The next time you come to SAS, [50:10] be totally different. Thanks everybody.",2025-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGlDQV-lVNc
